### Define Package

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/other/1674124021982/line-2000-gray.png)

#### Summary

Sometimes spools are only a piece of the workflow. Whether it's packaging multi-trade racks or entire electrical rooms, multiple spools often need to be packaged and assembled as one. Prefab Packages makes this process seamless by allowing the user to quickly define multiple spools to a package and create deliverables right from the model.

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/other/1674124051830/line-2000-gray-dark.png)

### Usage

#### Defining a Package

1.  From the eVolve ribbon, in the **Prefabrication** panel, click **Define Package**.
2.  From the _Create/Define Package_ window, enter a package name, select desired options, and click **OK**.
3.  From the drawing area, using a window selection or crossing window selection, choose the desired elements to include in the package and click **Finish** from the _Options Bar_.
4.  Continue to select elements for other packages or click **Finish** in the _Options Bar_ to complete the session.

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/other/1674124063289/line-2000-gray-dark.png)

### Window Overview

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/articles/e17ux1rqjv/1718902626570/image.png)

**NOTE**: The _Create/Define Package's_ predefined selection filter can be modified via the _Selection Configuration_. Please see the link in the **Relevant Articles** below.

1.  **Package Name** - The value specified will be applied to all elements selected to be included in the package. While the name may be alphanumeric, it must end with a numeric value.
2.  **Prompt for name on each definition** - when enabled, the _Define Package_ window is displayed after defining every package, providing an opportunity to assign a unique name to each package.
3.  **Create Sheets(s) on Finish** - If enabled, eVolve will create the sheets for the defined packages(s) on finish using the title-block defined in step 3. If disabled, the package sheets may be created within the Prefab Manager.
4.  **Title Block** - If **Create Sheet(s) on Finish** is enabled, the selected Title Block will be applied to all defined packages.
5.  **Title Block Type** - If applicable, this field is used to define the type of the selected title block family.
6.  **Open Created Sheet(s)** - if enabled, all created sheets will open after completing the session.
    
    **NOTE**: Packages may be defined and created at the same time, or they may be defined and then created through the _Prefab Manager_.

### Tips and Tricks

#### Managing Packages

Once created, there are various ways to monitor and maintain packages within a model.

All package information is contained within shared parameters that are visible from the Revit Properties Panel. This allows for view filters, as well as Element Filters, to quickly be created for finding and displaying package information.

The parameter "eV\_PackageId" is the parameter used by EVOLVE to identify a package. Parameters starting with "eV\_Package..." should not be modified manually.

This information is also available within the Spool Manager.

#### Package Template Titleblocks

1.  Ensure package parameters are unchecked in any view templates used for package title block templates.
2.  Ensure there is not default plan view template in the project. This will override the chosen view template from the prefab sheet.

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/articles/e17ux1rqjv/1722523778514/image.png)

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/uuudojgxkp/articles/gfryznzy1w/1607637615041/image.png)

1.  Remember to stretch schedules to match the size needed on the sheet before saving them as a view template. When modifying a schedule use the **Resize** button to measure the width of the schedule, set the width of the schedule in the corresponding titleblock view window. **Modify Schedule/Quantities** tab ⮞ **Columns** panel ⮞ **Rezise** button.![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/articles/e17ux1rqjv/1713272633533/resize-butto.png)

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/articles/e17ux1rqjv/1709638464558/line-2000-gray-very-light-single.png)

#### Naming Packages

Package names may be automatically generated by utilizing the parameters of the elements contained within the package. While users can specify a value to apply to a defined package, the Package Name dialog is also a menu containing Revit and eVolve parameters. The parameters may be appended or chained together to provide a more descriptive name.

The bolded value below will generate the following spool names.

**Electrical Examples**

-   **<eE\_ConduitRun\_System> - <eV\_LBS\_Id> - 01**
    -   Branch - L1A-01
    -   Feeder - L2B -02
    -   Fire Alarm - L3C -03

**Mechanical Examples**

-   **<eM\_Service Name> - <eM\_Service Type> - 01**
    -   Return Air 2wg - Rectangular Duct -01
    -   Return Air 2wg - Rectangular Duct -02
    -   Return Air 2wg - Round Duct -03

### Window Overview

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/articles/z4v8j4ynju/1718902559141/image.png)

**NOTE**: The _Create/Define Spool's_ predefined selection filter can be modified via the _Selection Configuration_. Please see the link in the **Relevant Articles** below.

1.  **Starting Spool Name** - The value specified will be applied to all spools created in the session. While the name may be alphanumeric, it must end with a numeric value.

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/other/1674123781789/image.png)

### Tips and Tricks

1.  When a new spool is created, the name is initially set by Revit. Any _Parameter Sync_ based rules, including _Colorizer_, will execute against the name Revit assumes should be the next spool if the rule is set to run against new elements of type _Assembly Instance_. The _Revit API_ does not allow changes to the name of the spool until the transaction that creates the spool has been committed. Once the spool is created, EVOLVE applies the name (specified by the user) to the spool. If the rule is set to run on **Existing Element Change** or **Any Update**, then the rule will be triggered to execute against the correct name. The **Allow Multiple Processing** option must be enabled or the rule will only execute on the name initially set by Revit.
2.  When defining multiple spools, the spool number is auto-incremented.
3.  After exiting, the last spool number is remembered and auto incrementation continues when resuming Define Spool.
4.  Spools may be defined from the eVolve Electrical tab or the contextual ribbon.
5.  The **Create Sheet(s) on Finish** checkbox is typically used when generating a few sheets. If generating many sheets, use the Spool Manager.
6.  When defining a spool, existing spools cannot be added to the spool.
7.  When defining a spool:
    1.  Typical Revit selection methods may be used.
    2.  A single click adds all parts and pieces of nested families to a spool.
    3.  The **CTRL** key does not need to be pressed to add elements to the spool.
        1.  When selected, elements are typically highlighted and blue in color. However, after being selected, some elements may not appear to be highlighted. Hover the pointer over an element to verify that the element has been added to the spool.
        2.  When hovering, if an element has not been added a plus symbol (+) appears, click to add the element. If an element has been added, a minus symbol (-) appears, click to remove the element.
8.  Spool names may be automatically generated by utilizing the parameters of the elements contained within the spool. While users can specify a value to apply to defined spools, the Starting Spool Name dialog is also a menu containing Revit and eVolve parameters. The parameters may be appended or chained together for a more descriptive name.  
    The bolded value below will generate the following spool names

**Electrical Examples**

-   **<eE\_ConduitRun\_System> - <eV\_LBS\_Id> - 01**
    -   Branch - L1A-01
    -   Feeder - L2B -02
    -   Fire Alarm - L3C -03

**Mechanical Examples**

-   **<eM\_Service Name> - <eM\_Service Type> - 01**
    -   Return Air 2wg - Rectangular Duct -01
    -   Return Air 2wg - Rectangular Duct -02
    -   Return Air 2wg - Round Duct -03

### Window Overview

#### Overview of the Spool tab

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/05s9b4gl38/articles/ylwy5wm71o/1725541038784/image.png)

**Display By** menu

-   **Project** - displays spools and packages in the entire project.
-   **Current View** - displays spools and packages that are in the active view.
-   **Current Selection** - displays selected spools and packages.

##### Tool Palette Buttons

-   **Locate Element** - used to locate a single element in the model. If the selected element is in the currently active view, Locate Element will zoom to and display the element in fullscreen. If the selected element is not in the currently active view, Locate Element will allow Revit to find the element.
-   **Rename Spools** - allows for one or multiple spool names to be modified.
-   **Delete Spools** - allows for one or multiple spools(assemblies) to be deleted. Note this function does not delete the elements within the spool, just the association between the elements.
-   **Renumber** - allows spools to be renumbered using the predefined rules within the Renumber feature.
-   **Create Package** - generates an eVolve Package.
-   **Generate Sheets** - creates sheets for selected spools.
-   **Open Selected Sheets** - displays sheets for selected spools if the sheets have been generated.
-   **Create View/Sheet Set** - produces a View/Sheet Set.
-   **Calculate View Rotation** - this function will attempt to calculate a rotation so that the spooled elements are square to the elevation and section views that are created. When running this function, two options will be provided as methods to calculate the proper rotation angle:
    
    1.  "Yes" = EVOLVE will look for a corresponding scope box to calculate the appropriate angle
    2.  "No" = EVOLVE will calculate the rotation angle by the longest straight element within the spool.
    
    Note: Typically, option 2 (selecting No) is the preferred method and provides the best results.
