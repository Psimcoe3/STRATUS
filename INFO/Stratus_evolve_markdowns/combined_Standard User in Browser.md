# Areas (Admin) - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> Configuring Areas, also referred to as BIM Areas, the Work Breakdown Structure, or the Construction Sequence, is key to being able to filter the model, create assemblies, and define work packages efficiently. Project deliverables are dependent on configured project Project Areas (Package Per Area Breakdown). The Package "Per Area Breakdown" number depends on the number of hierarchical areas defined in the project. For example, an AutoCAD model by default might only have the building as an area, whereas a Revit model might include a more granular hierarchical breakdown by Level, Scope Box, Room, etc.

## Manage Areas

The Manage Areas button controls which areas display in the viewers.

## Add Areas

**To add Areas to the Viewers:**

1.  Publish a model and open it in the Models Viewer. Initially, there are no areas because they have not yet been selected.
    
2.  To Assign Areas, go to Projects > Areas. In this example, the model has just been published and no areas have been assigned.
    
3.  Click the **Manage Areas** button and **Select a Model**.  
    **Note: Select the model** that will be used to define areas for all models in the project.
    
4.  With the model selected, options to select Levels, Scope Boxes, and Zones displays depending on the Authoring tool. Levels must be checked.
    
5.  With Levels and Scope Boxes checked, the Levels display and are collapsed by default.
    
6.  Expand a level by clicking its **expand down arrow button** or expand all by clicking the **Expand All** button. The subareas (Ex. Scope Boxes) display. Check one or more levels (Ex. L01) and Scope Boxes (Ex. OA1, etc.) that will become areas in the Viewer. All parts in these areas will be assigned to the areas.
    
7.  To expedite the selection of areas, enter a value in the **Search** text box and then click the **Check Matches** button. Use the **Uncheck Matches** to uncheck any selected areas.
    
8.  Before clicking update, in this example, this level and these scope boxes have been selected.
    
9.  Click the **Update** button.
    
10.  The Projects > Areas page refreshes:
    
    1.  The selected Levels and Scope boxes populate the data table.
        
    2.  The Models Viewer is updated to display the selected Areas. Any deselected areas would be removed from the Models Viewer.
        
    3.  The **Stratus.Part.BIMArea** property for each part in the area is now populated with the area.
        
    4.  The **Assign Parts** buttons, **Assign Parts (All Models)** and **Assign Unassigned Parts (All Models)** are highlighted yellow.
        

## Delete Areas

**To delete Areas from the Viewers:**

1.  In this example, the data table has been edited and two Abbreviations have been added.
    
2.  Click the **Manage Areas** button and expand the currently selected level (Ex. L01). The scope boxes areas will display.
    
3.  Uncheck several scope box areas like these 4 scope boxes. **Note**: The SC-OB2 Abbreviation was previously entered in the data table for this scope box area.
    
4.  Click **Update**.
    
    1.  The **Project Areas** pages displays:
        
        1.  The unchecked scope box areas are removed from the data table.
            
        2.  Since the row (Area) OB2 was deleted, the Abbreviation (Ex. SC-OB2) for that row has also been deleted.
            
        3.  The row (Area) OA1 is still selected, therefore, the Abbreviation (Ex. SC-OA1) remains.
            
        4.  The **Assign Parts** buttons are highlighted yellow.
            
    2.  In the **Models Viewer**:
        
        1.  The unchecked scope box areas (Ex. OB1, etc.) are deleted from the viewer.
            
        2.  For the deleted areas, the Stratus.Part.BIMArea property value has been deleted.
            

## Edit Areas

## Area Data Editing

1.  **Edit Row (Area) Data** - Double-click a row to edit the row data.
    
2.  **Name** - The imported areas will display in a tree structure under the Name column. The name of each Level, Scope Box, etc. will display. Names are not editable, but the Sort order is editable. See the Sort by Name and Sort by Elevation options below.
    
3.  **Delete** - Select a row and then click **Delete** to delete the row.
    
    1.  The Delete Area prompt will display.
        
    2.  Click **OK**. The area will be deleted from the viewers and the Area data table.
        
    3.  **Note**: To add the area back into the viewers, click **Manage Areas,** check the area, and then on the Areas page, click the **Assign Parts (All Models)** button. Otherwise, the area will not display in the viewer.
        
4.  **Save** \- Select an area, edit a cell value (Ex. Abbreviation, Elevation, Range). The Save button is enabled. Click the **Save** button, or, click anywhere on the page and the value will be saved.
    
5.  **Cancel** \- Select an area, edit a cell value (Ex. Abbreviation, Elevation, Range). The Cancel button is enabled. Click the **Cancel** button and the value will be cancelled.
    
6.  **Expand All** - By default, all areas are expanded. Use the Expand All button to expand the areas after they have been collapsed.
    
7.  **Collapse All** - Use the Collapse All button to collapse all areas to the highest tree branch, usually the model. Expand the model to view collapsed Levels.

8.  **Add Row Below** - The **Add Row Below** button is intended for those projects where the admin wants to manually build a hierarchy of areas and manually choose the relationships between them (Ex. grid areas, scope boxes, etc.). The **Add Row Below** button enables you to add an area row below the selected area. When clicked, a copy of the selected row will be add to the data grid. Edit the row as needed. **Note**: In one of the Viewers, Filter by Area and the newly added area row will display. It does not yet have any parts associated with it. See the Graphical Selector section below. 
    
9.  **Add Row Child** - The **Add Row Child** button is intended for those projects where the admin wants to manually build a hierarchy of areas and manually choose the relationships between them (Ex. grid areas, scope boxes, etc.). Click the **Add Row Child** button to add an indented row (child) to the selected row. The selected row becomes a parent row that can be expanded and collapsed. Edit the row as needed. **Note**: In one of the Viewers, Filter by Area and the newly added area row will display. It does not yet have any parts associated with it. See the Graphical Selector section below.
    
10.  **Assign Parts (All Models)** - The **Assign Parts (All Models)** is enabled after any change is made to the data table and when a model is published. Click the **Assign Parts (All Models)** button when the changes should be applied to all parts.
    
    1.  For example, if **Abbreviations** have been added to one or more rows, then the STRATUS.Part.BIMAbbreviation property will be added to all parts in the specified area.
        
11.  **Assign Unassigned Parts (All Models)** - The **Assign Unassigned Parts (All Models)** button is enabled after any change is made to the data table and when a model is published. The **Assign Unassigned Parts (All Models)** button can be clicked during subsequent model publishes to ensure that parts are correctly assigned to new model areas and that existing parts that have already been assigned are not modified.
    
12.  **Arrows** 
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/f6a34a61-1b04-4880-a835-e7fb6c2794bc)
    
    1.  **Up** - Moves the selected row up.
        
    2.  **Down** - Moves the selected row down.
        
    3.  **Left** - Outdents the selected row so that a child row is at the same level as a parent.
        
    4.  **Right** - Indents the selected row so that the row becomes a child of the row above.
        
13.  **Sort by Name** - Click **Sort by Name** to sort the rows by the Name column in alphabetic order.  
    **Note**: The row order on the Areas page will drive the row order on the Projects > Deliverables page. 
    
14.  **Sort by Elevation** \- Click **Sort by Elevation** to sort the rows by the Elevation column (lowest to highest).  
    **Note**: The row order on the Areas page will drive the row order on the Projects > Deliverables page. 
    
15.  **Graphical Selector** - By default, when the model includes Levels, Scope Boxes, Zones, Rooms, and Spaces, those will be automatically be matched up when the Import as Areas button is clicked (above).  The Graphical Selector can be used to override or redefine areas in the model that will be assigned to the selected row area.  
    
    1.  The **Graphical Selector** is accessed by double-clicking any area row and clicking the **Graphical Selector** button in the Contents column.  The Select Regions for Area dialog will display. In this example, the region displays and since Scope Boxes were defined in the model, the SB (Scope Box) button is automatically selected, and the row area's scope box checkbox is selected.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/b9503460-b2df-4312-813c-309064ff0314)
        
        1.  **Clear Area** - The Clear Area button (not displayed) can be used to clear out previous data and selections enabling the user to check areas.
            
    2.  **Display grid** - To override default area settings, click the **Display grid** button to display grid cells with a checkbox in the center. Grids will display if the model includes Display Grids. By clicking a checkbox, any part whose centroid is within the grid cell will be assigned to the selected area.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/993a492a-5d45-48b5-9239-5208722be3d4)
        
        1.  Click **Done**. The Areas table will refresh and the Contents of the select row will update with the number of grid cells that are included in the area.
            
        2.  Since the Area data has been edited, the **Assign Unassigned Parts (All Models)** button will highlight yellow indicating that the parts have not yet been assigned to the area. Click the **Assign Unassigned Parts (All Models)** button to assign all parts in the model to the areas noted on the Areas page.
            
    3.  **RM** - Click the RM button to manually select Room regions for the area of the selected row.
        
    4.  **SM** - Click the SB button to manually select Scope Box regions for the area of the selected row. **Note**: If an assembly is inside two scope boxes, all assembly parts will be assigned to the area where the assembly centroid is located. 
        
    5.  **SP** - Click the SP button to manually select Space regions for the area of the selected row.
        
    6.  **Grid Line Note**: For Grid Lines to display properly:
        
        1.  In the model, finalize any name changes to the grid lines. Grid line definitions for a model are purged and reloaded on every model publish. If a grid line name changes, links to those names are broken in Stratus.
            
        2.  If the model is republished with updated grid line names:
            
            1.  Use the **Clear Area** button to clear all grid cell associations to project areas and remove all part area associations.
                
            2.  Using the areas tools, rebuild the grid cell associations so that the project areas are linked to the correct grid line names and the parts are associated with the correct areas. You can assign the grid cells at all levels of the project area tree structure. Do this for several areas and auto-assign parts. Make sure these associations are correct using the Models > Viewer > Display Modes > Areas tab.
                
16.  **Abbreviation** - Manually enter an abbreviation for each row if you want Stratus to automatically use the Area Abbreviation field as part of your assembly or package naming scheme under Admin > Company > Naming Conventions. See the [**Naming and Numbering (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913") article for more information. Since area abbreviations are used within the name of an assembly or package, you'll want to standardize the naming scheme and keep them short.
    
17.  **Elevation** - While you can edit the elevation, this elevation comes from the model so won't likely need to be changed.
    
18.  **Range Bottom Offset and Range Top Offset** - The Range Bottom and Range Top settings tell Stratus which parts in the Z will be included in the area. 
    
    1.  For example, in the Models > Viewer, you may filter to an area that should include anchors, but it doesn't. This is because the anchor centroid is outside of the Range Bottom or Range Top setting.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/702921da-46a7-4ca6-bd2a-cf3f9ec5d8c1)
        
    2.  In this example, I'll enter -5" as the Range Bottom Offset for all of the Roof areas, and, to "offset" this I'll enter -5" as the Range Top Offset for all of the Level 1 areas.
        
    3.  If any changes are made, click the **Assign Parts (All Models)** button to assign parts to the area. 
        
    4.  Once the Models > Viewer is refreshed, Filter to the Areas (Roof), the anchors now display.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/0f41ff72-fb49-4a1f-a560-b25f15607c50)
        
19.  **Code** - The Code represents a sub-string for cost coding. The Code will be used in the future but is not currently an active feature.
    
20.  **Color** - Row colors display in the Viewers under Display Modes > Areas. 
    

## Questions

**Q:** If after defining project areas the model is republished, will project areas be lost.  
**A:** No, republishing the model does not overwrite or delete project areas defined in Stratus. In fact, if new parts are added to an area in the model, they will be included in the defined area in Stratus. And, if parts are removed from the model, they will also be removed from Stratus.

**Q:** Are project areas imported back into the model or drawing?  
**A:** No. A Project Area is a Stratus only definition. It really does not need to be part of the model or drawing data.

**Q:** I have already set project areas by clicking the Assign Parts button. If the model is republished, will the new parts added to the model be assigned the correct project area?  
**A:** Yes, the Part Property = Stratus.Part.BIMArea will be assigned the correct area based on the project area assignments.

## Summary

The Assemblies Dashboard displays assemblies filtered by Project, Model, Division, Package, and Status.  The list can be further filtered by column filters or sort options. Each assembly displays information including a link to packages that contain the assembly. Each assembly can be expanded to display its child parts.![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/8912924/image2023-10-5_15-23-49.png?version=1&modificationDate=1696537431378&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

1.  **Dashboard or Viewer default** - Hover over the Dashboard or Viewer tab and click the checkbox to set it as the default tab when the Assemblies button is clicked.
2.  **Project** - Select one project or the ALL PROJECTS option. **Note**: Loading 100 assemblies will take about 15 seconds. 
    
3.  **Model** - Select one model or the ALL MODELS option within the selected project. **Note**: Loading 100 assemblies will take about 15 seconds. 
    
4.  **Division** - Filter the list to one or ALL Divisions.
    
5.  **Package** - Filter the list to one package or Unspecified for all packages.
    
6.  **Status** - Filter the list to one or more Tracking Statuses.
7.  **Import CSV** - Import assembly row data from a CSV file. 
8.  **Clear Cached Calculated Field Values and Reload Data Table** button - When User A loads the Assemblies Dashboard page for the first time, if there are any calculated fields in the report, they are cached. As a result, the next time any user loads the page the cached data will be retrieved faster than the original load. Cached data is purged and cached either manually using the **Clear Cached Calculated Field Values and Reload Data Table** button or automatically. Note: The same button is also implemented on the Packages Dashboard. 
    
    Assemblies Dashboard calculated cached values are automatically purged when:
    
    -   any type of assembly modification is made such as editing parts in the assembly
        
    -   using a field that is a total value from all parts in the assembly
        
    -   a Field references a Part property or another Field value, and they are modified
        
9.  **Assembly Report** - The Default Assembly Report includes the fields and functionality described below. Users can configure a custom assembly report. For the custom assembly report to display in the drop-down list, its Item Type = Assembly and the checkbox for Assemblies Dashboard must be checked. See the **[Reports (Admin)](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393/Reports+Admin)** article for more information.
    
    1.  **Multiple Entry Selection and Action** - Multiple entries (rows) can be selected and then an action can be taken on those entries (Ex. Update Tracking Status, edit an editable field, and Delete). See the **[Multiple Entry Selection and Action FAQ](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1963720705/Multiple+Entry+Selection+and+Action)** for more information and examples.
    2.  **Expand / Collapse** \- Expand to view the assembly’s parts. Collapse to hide the assembly’s parts.
        
    3.  **Type** - The assembly type is detected as one of the following:
        1.  **Assembly** - if AssemblyType.RevitAssembly = Assembly, used with Revit or unspecified models
        2.  **Conduit** - if AssemblyType.RevitCustomMark = Conduit, used for models that include Bendworks items
        3.  **Custom** - if AssemblyType.RevitParameter = Custom
        4.  **Family** - if AssemblyType.RevitNestedFamily = Family
        5.  **Hanger** - if AssemblyType.RevitHanger = Hanger, used for models that include HangerWorks items

            1.  Click the assembly's **Upload Attachment** ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/8912924/image2020-1-22_9-14-49.png?version=1&modificationDate=1579706507306&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) button to locate and upload a part attachment.
            2.  Once a file is attached the **Open Attachments**![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/8912924/image2019-10-1_10-14-45.png?version=1&modificationDate=1579706507434&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) button will display and can be clicked to open the attachment. The attachment can also be opened under the Assemblies > Viewer > Attachments tab.
        11.  **Delete** **(Displays on custom report too)** - Click the **Delete** button to be prompted to delete the assembly. The parts will be disassociated from the assembly but will retain their current tracking status.  For Delete assembly permission, check **Delete** under Admin > Company > Project Roles > Assemblies > Dashboard.
            
        12.  **Delete** **(Displays on custom report too)** \- Assemblies whose tracking status has the "Can Assemble" checkbox checked under Admin > Company > Tracking Statuses can be deleted. When an assembly cannot be deleted, these options will not display.  
            1.  **Delete** - Assemblies that have been deleted in STRATUS are not “hard deleted” from the STRATUS database until the model is re-published from Revit or AutoCAD back into STRATUS.  Scenarios like the following are handled. Be sure to understand the Import message that displays following an import.
                1.  Creating a new STRATUS assembly with the same name as one just deleted and with different parts than the deleted assembly.
                2.  Creating a new assembly with the deleted assembly’s name and with a subset of the deleted assembly’s parts.
                3.  Note: Revit and AutoCAD, unlike STRATUS, do not save changes until you explicitly save them or run a publish. Therefore, if during a STRATUS Import, Revit or AutoCAD crashes, change since the last save will be lost. In addition, the next Import will re-do whatever is different in STRATUS from that point rather than from the point of your previous unsaved imports.
        13.  **Show** - Show All entries or limit to a set number of rows to improve performance.
        14.  **CSV | Excel** - Download the data table list as a CSV or Excel file format.
        15.  **Search** - Filter the list by searching for specific characters.
        16.  **Sort** \- The list of assemblies can be sorted by Assembly Name, Packages, Parts, Hours, Status, User, or Date-Time.
            
        17.  **Filter** - The list of assemblies can be filtered by Packages, Parts, Hours, Status, User, and Date-Time. 
            1.  **Status Filter Note** - In the Status filter, only tracking Statuses where "Can Assemble" and "Applies to Assembly"  are checked will display in the list.
            2.  **Date-Time Note:** The Date-Time or any date column will display the From and To date range dialog.  
                ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/8912924/image2022-6-7_15-16-22.png?version=1&modificationDate=1654632983400&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

10.  **Part Report** - The Default Part Report includes the following fields and functionality. Users can configure a custom part report. The custom part report will display in the Part Report drop-down when the report Item Type = Part and the checkbox for Assemblies Dashboard is checked.
    
    1.  **Quantity (Displays on custom report too)** - Displays the quantity of parts in the assembly. Since the default report does not include any merge or totaling options, the quantity will always be 1.
        
    2.  **Description** \- Displays the part description.
        
    3.  **Assembly Name** - Displays the name of the assembly for which the part is included.
        
    4.  **Hours** \- Displays the number of actual part Hours entered while updating the part’s tracking status. Actual hours can be manually entered during the Update Tracking Status prompt. This prompt displays:
        
        1.  On the Assemblies > Dashboard tab when the tracking Status is updated within the Assembly Report.
            
        2.  On the Assemblies > Viewer tab when the tracking Status is updated.

## Open Assembly

**Project Drop-down Set to Active Package**  
The Assemblies > Viewer top navigation includes a Package drop-down. The last package opened or refreshed by the user in the Packages > Viewer is stored as the **active** package for the model. When an assembly is opened, STRATUS will check to see if the assembly is included in the **active** package. If it is that package name will display in the Assemblies > Viewer > Package drop-down. Otherwise, the Package drop-down will display **Unspecified**.

## Open Assembly from the Models Viewer

1.  In the Models > Viewer the Project and Model are selected.
    
2.  A link to assemblies displays in 2 places:
    
    1.  Under Filters > Assemblies, click the link to the assembly.
        
    2.  Under Display Modes > Assemblies
        
    3.  Under Actions > Assemblies. In this case, a part in the assembly must be selected in the Models > Viewer to display.
        
3.  The assembly will display with the same Project, Model, and Assembly selected. For the Project:
    
    1.  If the assembly is included in the **active** package, the package name will display in the Package drop-down.
        
    2.  If the assembly is not part of the **active** package, the Package drop-down will display **Unspecified**.
        

## Open Assembly from the Packages > Viewer

**Project Drop-down:** Set to Active Package

1.  With the Packages > Viewer opened to a package that includes assemblies, click the assembly link to open the assembly in the Assemblies > Viewer. Links to assemblies can be found under:
    
    1.  Toolbar > Display Nodes
        
    2.  Toolbar > Filters > Assemblies
        
    3.  Packages > Viewer > Items > Assemblies.
        
2.  The assembly will display in the Assemblies > Viewer and Package will be set to the active package.
    
3.  If the Assemblies tab was clicked, the Assemblies page will open to the user’s default Assemblies tab (Dashboard (below) or Viewer) and the active Project will be set in the Package drop-down.
    

## Open Assembly from the STRATUS Home Page

**Project Drop-down Set to Active Package**  
The active package is remembered from session to session. This examples shows Recent assemblies on the STRATUS home page.

1.  The 2 assemblies below that are in the active package will open the Assemblies > Viewer and the Package will be set to the active packge.
    
2.  The other assemblies which are not in the active package will open the Assemblies > Viewer and the Package will be set Unspecified.
    

## Open Assembly from the Assemblies > Dashboard

**Project Drop-down**: The selected assembly displayed on the Assemblies > Dashboard works independently from the Packages active package. Also note, for a Package to display in the Assemblies > Dashboard > Package drop-down list, it must contain at least 1 assembly, otherwise it will be filtered out.

1.  In the Assemblies > Dashboard, 1 Project or ALL PROJECTS and 1 Model or ALL MODELS can be selected.  **Note**: In this example, there are not additional filters for Division or Status and Package is Unspecified. If a Package were selected, assemblies not in the selected package would be filtered off the Dashboard.
    
2.  Initially, the Package drop-down will display Unspecified.
    
3.  **Open an Assembly included in a Package** - To open an assembly that is included in a package, click the **Assembly Name** link. **Note**: In this example, the Default Report is displaying.
    
    1.  The assembly will display and the package name will display in the Package drop-down.
        
4.  **Open an Assembly NOT included in a Package** - To open an assembly that is not included in a package, click the **Assembly Name** link. 
    
    1.  The assembly will display and the Package drop-down will display Unspecified.
        

## Open Assembly by Scanning QR Code with Handheld Scanner

The **Scan assembly QR code using handheld scanner** button uses a configured handheld scanner. A user can scan an assembly QR code and the assembly will display. This will save clicks and the need to know the name of the project, model, package, or spool assembly. 

1.  Under **Assemblies** > **Viewer**, click the **Under Assemblies > Viewer**, click the **Scan assembly QR code using handheld scanner** button.
    
2.  The word **SCANNING** will display. The scanner will continue to wait for input until it detects a scan, keyboard action, or mouse click.
    
3.  Scan the assembly QR code with the handheld scanner.
    
4.  The assembly associated with the QR code will display.
    

## Open Assembly by Scanning QR Code with the Tablet’s Camera

The **Scan assembly QR code using camera** button uses the built-in camera on a tablet or phone as a scanner. A user can scan an assembly QR code and the assembly will display. This will save clicks and the need to know the name of the project, model, package, or spool assembly.  **Note**: For iPad users, this feature only works when you have logged into STRATUS using the Safari web browser. 

1.  Login to STRATUS on the tablet or phone.
    
2.  Under **Assemblies** > **Viewer**, click the **Scan QR code with camera** button.
    
3.  The **Capture an Image** prompt will display asking if you “**Would like to Access the Camera**.” Click **Allow**.

1.  From the Containers > Dashboard, expand a Container to which an assembly has been added.
    
2.  Click the assembly Name link to open the assembly in a separate browser. 
    
3.  The assembly will display with the Project, Model, and Assembly names. For the Project:
    
    1.  If the assembly is not in the active package, the Package drop-down will display **Unspecified**.
        
    2.  If the assembly is in the active package, the Package drop-down will display the active package name.
        

## Viewer Filtering

Once an assembly is opened, other assemblies can be located using the filtering Assemblies > Viewer filter options for Project, Model, View, Package, and Assembly, or using one of the [**Open Assembly**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8749081/Assemblies+Viewer#Open-Assembly "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8749081/Assemblies+Viewer#Open-Assembly") methods.

## Project

To locate an assembly in a different Project:

1.  Click the **Project** drop-down and either select the project or search for the project.
    
2.  When switching to a new project, STRATUS will not know which model you intend to open. Therefore, STRATUS will look for the:
    
    1.  The first model, sorted alphabetically, that contains an assembly will be selected, then the first assembly sorted alphabetically.
        
    2.  If no models include an assembly, the Models > Dashboard will display.
        

## Model

To locate an assembly in a different Model within the Project:

1.  Click the **Model** drop-down and either select the model or search for the model. Only models that include at least one assembly will display in the drop-down.
    
2.  When switching to a new model, STRATUS will not know which assembly you intend to open.
    
    1.  Therefore, the last assembly sorted alphabetically will be selected.
        

## View

By default, all published models include a 3D view. The person who publishes the model can select additional views including 2D views. 90% of the time the default view in the Assemblies Viewer will display the needed information. In some cases, the default view may not include all of the model parts and will need to be overridden. **Note**: Overriding the View will set the newly selected view as the default for all users.

**To change the View in the 3D viewer:**

1.  **Project Admins Only** - Only Project Admins can change and override a default view. Users who are not a Project Admin under Admin > Project > Team do not have a **View** option in the Packages Viewer. Below is an example where the View drop-down does not display.
    
2.  **Override a View**
    
    1.  **Selected View Does Not Contain All Parts** - A Project Admin may select a default View that does not contain all the parts in the assembly and a warning icon will display "View does not contain all parts in the Packages".  
        
        1.  In this example, the **Top half view** displays the full dimensions of the pipe but does not display the bottom pipe parts because they were not included in this Revit view.  
            
        2.  To resolve the issue, a Project Admin will need to override the default view.
            
            1.  If the Project Admin selects a view that does not include all of the model parts included in the Assembly, the following message will display and the Project Admin will need to select a different view.
                
    2.  **Selected View Contains All Parts** - Once the Project Admin selects a view that contains all of the model parts included in the Assembly, the following prompt will display. **Note**: Making a View change will set the selected view as the default view.
        
    3.   After a Project Admin selects a view (Ex. **Full model**) that includes all of the model parts for the Assembly, anyone who opens the Assemblywill see the selected view.
        

## Package

To locate an assembly in a different Package within the same Project and Model:

1.  Click the Package drop-down. For long lists of packages, enter any portion of the package name into the search to filter the list. Packages displays packages in alphabetic order. If a package does not include an assembly, it will not display in the Package drop-down list. The list of assemblies are limited to those within the selected Package.
    
2.  **Select** a different package. STRATUS will open the first alphabetic assembly within the package.
    

## Assembly

The Assembly filter displays assemblies in alphabetic order. For long lists of assemblies, enter any portion of the assembly name into the search to filter the list. When selecting a different assembly within the same View, the assembly will display almost instantly. Alternatively, if the newly selected assembly does not use the same View, the model will need to be reloaded (the Powered by Autodesk logo will display in the viewer).

1.  To switch to a different assembly, click the **Assembly** drop-down:
    
    1.  **Package** - If the package is selected, only the assemblies within the package will display.
        
    2.  **Package is Unspecified** - When the Package is Unspecified, all packages (arrows) and their assemblies will display in the Assembly drop-down.
        

## 3D Viewer - Expand / Collapse

By default, the Assemblies > Viewer tab displays the 3D Viewer (left) and the assembly’s detailed content tabs (right). Clicking the expand to full screen button in either section will change both sections to full screen, one stacked on top of each other. 

Below are the mechanics of the Assemblies Viewer:

1.  **Default View** - 3D Viewer (left) and assembly’s detailed content tabs (right) and expander/collapse buttons in both panels. Click a part in the viewer and it will be selected in the in the assembly’s detailed contents Parts tab, or check a Part in the Parts tab and will be selected in the 3D Viewer.
    
2.  **Click the 3D panel expander** - The 3D View expands to full screen and the assembly’s detailed contents displays full screen below the 3D View. Click a part in the viewer and it will be selected in the in the assembly’s detailed contents Parts tab, or check a Part in the Parts tab and will be selected in the 3D Viewer.
    
3.  **Click the collapse button in either the 3D Viewer or assembly’s detailed content tabs** - The default view will display. In this example, when the 3D View was expanded to full screen the user zoomed in on the assembly, added dimensions, and then collapsing the panels retained both.
    
4.  **Click the assembly’s detailed content tabs expander** - The assembly’s detailed contents display on top and the 3D view on the bottom. In this example, the STRATUS Sheet tab was clicked and the zoom and dimensions are retained from the previous example.

## 3D Viewer - Rename Assembly

To rename an assembly within the assembly viewer, the assembly must be in a Tracking Status where Can Assemble is checked.

1.  If the assembly is in a Tracking Status where **Can Assemble** is checked, then hovering over the assembly name will display “Edit Assembly Name”.
    
    1.  To edit the assembly name, click the assembly name. The Rename Assembly dialog will display.
        
    2.  Enter a unique name and click the green Save button.
        
        1.  If the new assembly name is not unique, the “Could Not Rename the Assembly” message will display.
            
    3.  If the new assembly name is unique, the name will change.
        
    4.  The assembly name will also change on the Assemblies > Dashboard and anywhere the name is referenced.
        
2.  If the assembly is not in a Tracking Status where **Can Assemble** is checked, then hovering over the assembly name will display “Name is locked based on Tracking Status”.

### Project Roles

For information about permissioning the Numbering buttons, see the Project Roles [**Numbering**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/11534527/Project+Roles+Admin#Numbering "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/11534527/Project+Roles+Admin#Numbering") article.

### Display Tags and Item Numbers Toolbar

Clicking the **Display Tags and Item Numbers Toolbar** button:

1.  Displays any existing tags. See the [**Create Tags**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/edit-v2/8749081#Create-Tags "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/edit-v2/8749081#Create-Tags") section below.
    
2.  Opens a flyout that includes separate buttons for Renumber Parts, Create Tags, Delete Part Item Numbers, Delete All Tags, and Custom Tags. In each viewer, item numbering rules and tag shapes are controlled by the Administrator.
    

### Renumber Parts (Stratus.Part.Number)

For a part item number tag to display, the part’s Stratus.Part.Number must have a value.

1.  The company Admin configures several settings to define how and if parts are numbered. The settings control:
    
    1.  Whether or not assembled parts or unassembled parts can be numbered in a specific viewer (Model, Package, or Assembly).
        
    2.  How different parts are numbered based on Part Filters (Ex. The weld should include a Prefix or Suffix).
        
    3.  Whether or not to automatically renumber assembly parts when they are created or modified.
        
    4.  In addition, the **Can Number** Tracking Settings rule is honored when users attempt to number parts.
        
2.  Once the Item Number Scheme is configured by the Administrator, a part’s Stratus.Part.Number property value is set during a numbering action. Numbering actions are described below:
    
    1.  **Model Publish**
        
        1.  **Authoring Software is Right** - For companies who prefer to number parts in the authoring software, the only numbering action occurs during the publish process. **Note**: The admin can configure numbering rules so that the authoring software is used to number parts that match certain Part Filters while Stratus is used to number other parts. The Stratus.Part.Number value for parts that match the **Authoring Software is Right** rule cannot be numbered differently in STRATUS.
            
        2.  **Stratus is Always Right** - When a model is published for the first time, no part that matches a **Stratus is Always Right** numbering rule will include a value for the Stratus.Part.Number property. The value will be applied during a different numbering action. Then, when this model is imported, any Stratus.Part.Number property values that were populated in Stratus can be stored in Revit. When the model is republished, the Stratus.Part.Number property will be retained.
            
    2.  **Renumber Parts or Renumber and Tag Parts button** - When any user clicks the **Renumber Parts** button or the **Renumber and Tag Parts** button the Part Filter for each project Numbering Rule is checked. As soon as a part matches a filter it will be eligible to populate the Stratus.Part.Number and will not be matched with any other Part Filter.
        
        1.  **Note**: The button flyout can be displayed by either: 1) clicking the expand carrot or 2) by doing a long click (2 seconds) on the button.
            
        2.  **Note**: If you think parts should be numbered but are not, check with Administrator to ensure the assembled or unassembled parts can be numbered in the viewer you are in.
            
    3.  **Manually Edit Stratus.Part.Number property** - When the part’s Part Template Stratus.Part.Number property is editable, user’s with permission can manually edit the part’s Stratus.Part.Number property value.
        
        1.  **Note**: If you think parts should be numbered but are not, check with Administrator to ensure the assembled or unassembled parts can be numbered in the viewer you are in.
            
    4.  **Create or Modify an Assembly** - When a user creates a new assembly or modifies an existing assembly the assembly parts may automatically be numbered. Check with Administrator to determine if the **Renumber Parts When Creating or Modifying Assemblies** setting is checked for the part’s System Type.
        
3.  Once a part’s Stratus.Part.Number property is added or deleted in one viewer (Ex. Assemblies Viewer) it is added or deleted in all Viewers (Ex. Models Viewer and Packages Viewer).
    

### Create Tags

When the **Create Tags** or the **Renumber and Tag Parts** button is clicked in a viewer (Model, Package, or Assembly), the following tags can be created depending on how the Administrator has configured the Viewer Tags options.

1.  **Part item number tag** - For a part item number tag to be created, the part must have a Stratus.Part.Number property value.
    
2.  **Package** \- Package tags display in the Models Viewer and provide a link to the package.
    
3.  **Assemblies** \- Assemblies tags display in the Models Viewer and the Package Viewer and provide a link to the assembly.
    
4.  **Connected Assemblies** - Connected Assembly tags display in the Assemblies Viewer and provide a link to the connected assembly.
    
    1.  When a **Connected Assembly** tag link is clicked the messaging after clicking it will depend on whether or not the linked assembly belongs to the same package or not.
        
        1.  **Connected Assembly does not belong to any package** - In this example, the selected assembly (Ex. SLV002-HWS-002) does not belong to a package. When the **Open Assembly** link is clicked, the assembly will open without refreshing the page or giving a prompt.
            
        2.  **Connected Assembly does not belon to the same package** - In this example, the selected assembly (Ex. SLV001-HWS-001) belongs to the SLV001-L1\_B-Heating Water System package, however the linked assembly (Ex. SLV002-HWS-001) does not belong to the same package. As a result, when the **Open Assembly** link is clicked, the following dialog will display confirming you want to change packages.
            
5.  **Notes**:
    
    1.  **Dynamic Tags** - Tags dynamically display the current values of whatever property they are referencing. For standard item number tags, they will reference the **STRATUS.Part.Number** property. Existing static tags will be updated to dynamic tags once a change has been made to the **STRATUS.Part.Number** property or once new tags are placed.
        
    2.  Any tags that reference a blank value will be removed upon deletion of the value. For example, if the **STRATUS.Part.Number** property value is deleted, the related tag will also be deleted.
        
    3.  **Filters** - Only visible parts will be tagged, therefore, using a Filter (Ex. Company) that changes the viewers visible parts will impact tagging.
        
    4.  **Assembly Tags and Package Tags** - Assembly Tags and Package Tags will only display if the assembly or package existed when the **Create Tags** button was clicked.
        

### Custom Tags (Annotation Tags)

Custom Tags enable the user to add a Custom Tag to one or more parts. There are 5 Annotation Types: Item Numbering, Properties, Fields, Aliases, or Notes.

To place an annotation tag on a part:

1.  Click the **Custom Tags** tool button. The **Custom Tags** panel will display. 
    
2.  Select the **Annotation Type** (Ex. Properties). Properties also includes extra settings that other Annotation Types do not (Ex. Override Value). Notice that nothing displays in the Selected Tag field until an item under Properties is selected.
    
3.  Click the Properties drop-down and select an item (Ex. Diameter). Selected Tag now displays the selected property (Ex. Diameter). Select a Tag Shape if other than Rounded (default).
    
    1.  Begin typing the tag name to jump down in the list.
        
    2.  The most recently selected and active option is listed at the top of the panel on dropdown change.
        
    3.  Notes are defined under Admin > Company > Notes, or, can be added when a Tag Override Value Label is entered (see below).
        
4.  With the Annotation Type and item selected, click the part in the viewer and the Annotation Tag will display. The annotation tag will be placed on the centroid of the element.
    
5.  **Display the Prefix on Annotation Tags** - Check the **Display the Prefix on Annotation Tags** checkbox to add the tag prefix (Ex. Diameter).
    
6.  **Override Prefix** - Check the **Override Prefix** checkbox to enter a different prefix label (Ex Dia).
    
7.  **Override Value** - Check the **Override Value** checkbox to enter a different Label value. When the **Annotation Type** is Notes, a new assembly note can be created by selecting an existing note and entering an Override Value Label. 
    
8.  Once a tag is placed, it is connected to a lead. To move the tag: 
    
    1.  Hover over the tag and click the blue move 
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/c1fb3e47-53f0-44ff-b79a-c26cfb9ff129)
        
         button and let go of the mouse.
    2.  Move your mouse toward where you want to place the tag. The tag will disappear as you move your mouse. A leader will display and will follow your mouse.
        
    3.  Click the mouse when you are ready to place the tag. The tag will display.
        

### Bulk Delete

#### Bulk Delete

Click the **Bulk Delete** button to flyout the delete options. **Note**: No numbers or tags are impacted by clicking this button.

#### Delete Part Item Numbers

1.  Click the **Delete Part Item Numbers** button to remove values contained in the STRATUS.Part.Number property for all visible parts in the viewer. As a result:
    
    1.  The Part Item Numbers visible in the viewer are deleted in all Viewers (Models, Packages, and Assemblies)
        
    2.  Any tags that now reference a blank value are also deleted.
        
    3.  Custom Tags are not deleted.
        
2.  Click either the **Renumber Parts** or **Renumber and Tag Parts button** to regenerate Part Item Numbers.
    

#### Delete All Tags

1.  Click the **Delete All Tags** button to remove As a result the following tag types will be deleted if they are in the viewer:
    
    1.  Part Item Number
        
    2.  Connected Assemblies
        
    3.  Assembly
        
    4.  Package
        
    5.  Custom Tags
        

### Tag Management Leader

To move a **tag leader**, hover over the tag, click the blue drag icon, drag the tag and click to place the tag. The leader will display automatically.

#### Tag Management Delete Individual Tag

To **delete an individual tag**, hover over the tag and click the red delete icon. The tag will be deleted. All deleted tags, except a Custom Tag, can be regenerated in its original location by clicking the **Create Tags** button.  

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/99b7ddcb-cdb8-4bff-b232-0a61e32f7f91)

**Tag Connected Assemblies (Link)**

If an assembly is connected to another assembly, and the Assembly Viewer Tags > Connected Assemblies checkbox is checked in the Numbering Scheme, the connected assembly will display a link. When clicked, the assembly will display in the viewer.

### Sleeves, Saddles, Hangers

Sleeves, saddles, and hangers are not treated as a pipe branch. As a result, when calculating pipe length, they are ignored and pipe with the same diameter receive matching item numbers.

## Dimensioning

For information about permissioning the Dimensioning buttons, see the [**Dimensioning**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/11534527/Project+Roles+Admin#Dimensioning "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/11534527/Project+Roles+Admin#Dimensioning") Project Roles article.

### Auto-dimensioning

**Note**: In order for conduit dimensions to work properly, conduit elbows must have a Revit parameter named ‘Angle’.

#### Run Auto-dimension Routine

The **Run Auto-dimension Routine** tool places dimensions on the assembly automatically. To use the **Run Auto-dimension Routine** tool:

1.  Click the **Dimensioning** button, then click the **Run Auto-dimension Routine** button. That was easy!
    
2.  Here's what the **Run Auto-dimension Routine** tool is doing:
    
    1.  Adds the dimension tag between points.
        
    2.  Adds a tag for Angle (45)
        
    3.  Adds connected assemblies tag.
        
    4.  Any Kick 90's will receive a Rise tag:
        
    5.  Any offset regardless of spatial orientation will receive a Rise tag:
        
    6.  Adds a tag for measurements center to center between tees and to the nearest end, cap, elbow, branch, or cross.
        
    7.  Cleats display too.
        
3.  Once any tag is placed, it is connected to a lead. See the Assembly Annotation section below for screenshots on how to move a tag.
    
    1.  To move a tag:
        
        1.  Hover over the tag and click the blue move 
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/b6db4c43-2f4b-4aba-8611-8060b6cc6712)
            
             button and let go of the mouse. 
        2.  Move your mouse toward where you want to place the tag. The tag will disappear as you move your mouse. A leader will display and will follow your mouse.
            
        3.  Click the mouse when you are ready to place the tag. The tag will display.
            
        4.  Once tags are placed where you want them, the only way they will display for other users is to click the **Save Default Extensions** button. In addition to saving dimensions placed on an assembly, the **Save Default Extensions** setting is also a company user setting for which extensions are enabled by default whenever any assembly is loaded, like whether dimension lines should be turned on or if item numbers should be turned on.  
            
    2.  To move the leader’s attachment point:
        
        1.  Hover over the part’s centroid until the **\+ icon** displays.
            
        2.  Click the **\+ icon** and release the mouse.
            
        3.  Move the mouse to the new location and click. The attachment point will move.
            
        4.  To move the same attachment point again, hover at the base of the leader to locate the **\+ icon**.
            

#### Accidental Auto-dimension or Annotation Prompt

After the dimensions and/or annotations in the assembly viewer have been arranged, if you accidentally click the **Run Auto-dimension Routine** button, do the following.

1.  After setting dimensions and/or annotations, click the **Run Auto-dimension Routine** button.
    
2.  The **“Overwrite the existing dimensions?”** prompt will display. Click **OK** to overwrite or **Cancel** to stop the process.
    

#### Olets Recognized in Auto-Dimension Spool Assembly

The Auto-Dimension Spool Assembly recognizes olets and generates dimensions from the center of the outlet to the end of the pipe. These dimensions are automatically perpendicular to the outlet showing the olets proper orientation to the pipe. For example, if the branch is of the bottom of the pipe the dimension will pull off the bottom. 

#### Filtered Parts Do Not Dimension

In Packages and Assemblies Viewers, when a dimension is drawn between 2 parts (Part A and Part B) and a filter is applied that filters out one of the parts, the dimension will not display.

For example:

1.  Filter Off.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/7c5c3c04-0183-4c2b-b867-599c2c509596)
    
2.  Filter On.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/46402a2c-617e-455f-9cda-388bdcb923c3)
    

### Manual Dimensioning

To access the manual dimensioning tool, click the **Dimensioning** tool in the toolbar. The Dimensioning toolbar will display. The tools are described below.

#### Dimension Settings

Dimension Settings provides options to select Snaps and Click Detection.

**Snaps**

To set which snap points are used during dimension placement, click the **Dimension Settings** button.  The checked snap points in the screenshot below are selected by default.

**Click Detection**

The purpose of the **Click Detection** settings is to provide different mouse movement allowances (mouse down, mouse up, pan, zoom, and simultaneous mouse movement) when selecting snap points which can differ depending on the mouse settings and how the user clicks mouse buttons. During dimensioning, as the user hovers over a snap point, when a user clicks the mouse down button, **Click Detection** will consider both the elapsed time after the mouse down action and the movement of the mouse in terms of the pixel radius away from where mouse down was clicked. The table below displays the 3-option settings. Option 1 provides the least allowance while Option 3 provides triple the allowance.

|  | 
**Option 1 (Default)**

**To use Click Detection:**

1.  Under Dimensioning, click the **Dimensioning Settings** button.
    
2.  Scroll down to the **Click Detection** section.
    
3.  The default Click Detection setting will be selected.
    
4.  To change to one of the other 2 Click Detection settings, click and drag the slider button. The Click Detection description will change.
    
5.  Try out the new setting.
    

#### Dimensioning Status Toolbar

The **Dimensioning Status Toolbar** provides users with information while mousing over, adding, or moving a dimension.

**To use the Status Toolbar:**

1.  Click the **Dimensioning Status Toolbar** button on the Dimensioning flyout. The Dimensioning Status Toolbar will display.
    
2.  Hover over any snap point like this Center/Connector and its From or To value will display the part’s BOM Description (Ex. CI No Hub-Storm Drain).
    
3.  Once dimensioning has been placed, hover over any dimension to view the From/To and Point1/Point2 values.
    

#### Axis Colors

Like Autodesk, STRATUS utilizes standard colors for dimensions that are aligned with each of the primary coordinate axes.

-   **X = Red**
    
-   **Y = Green**
    
-   **Z = Purple**
    
-   **Off Axis = Blue** - The linear dimension is not aligned with any primary axis.
    

#### Revit Snap Points for all Parts

Dimension snap points for all Revit parts including hangers, racks, equipment, and any Revit object can be referenced using any of the Place dimension tools.

Below is an example of grabbing dimensions from the rack to the duct edge using the Place Aligned Length Measurement tool.

Below is an example of snap points for a trapeze hanger.

#### Place Linear Length Measurement

The Place Linear Length Measurement tool is used to dimension between 2 snap points on a cardinal plane.

**Key Features:**

1.  The tool will only measure one dimension at a time.
    
    1.  **To switch between the axis of measurements press Tab.**
        
    2.  If an axis of measurement does not change (i.e., a 0” measurement) that axis will be skipped.
        
2.  The leaders will be placed off the first snap point you select and the kick back line will be drawn to the second snap point selected to provide a visual representation of what the measurement line is representing.
    
    1.  (1) Leader
        
    2.  (2) Measurement Line
        
    3.  (3) Kick Back Line
        
3.  Right-click will cancel your action.
    
4.  Colors
    
    1.  Blue – Measures Up and Down
        
    2.  Green – Measures Front and Back
        
    3.  Red – Measures Left and Right
        
    4.  These colors will update with any UCS adjustments (more on UCS below)
        

**UCS:**

Some models or portions of models may not be perpendicular to the view, this is where the UCS comes in to play. The UCS will allow you to define a new Coordinate System to align Left/Right/Front/Back. Up and down will always remain the same.

To set a UCS:

1.  Open Dimension Settings
    
2.  Select “Custom”
    
3.  If you know the angle in which your model is rotated you can type it in, otherwise select the pencil
    
4.  Once the pencil is selected you will want to identify a straight piece of content that follows the angle you want adjust to.
    
5.  Once you have identified the piece of content you are going to use select the “Left” Center and then the “Right” Center
    
    1.  We recommend always using the Center snap point (Circle with a dot) to specify your angle to ensure you are getting the correct angle.
        

6.  When the Linear Dimensioning tool is active you can use the following buttons:
    
    1.  Global will disable your UCS and return you to default behavior.
        
    2.  Custom will enable your UCS
        
    3.  Top will bring you to a top view rotated to match your custom UCS.
        
        1.  This can be used to verify you have set your UCS correctly and get an easier angle to work with when placing your dimensions.
            
7.  Colors will update with the new UCS as well.
    
8.  Linear Dimension Button will update when a UCS is active
    

#### Place Aligned Length Measurement 

The Place Aligned Length Measurement tool makes it easier to dimension when points are not parallel aligned on a cardinal plane. It projects lines along a pivot point to better capture measurements along cardinal planes between snap points that are not aligned on a cardinal plane. The Place Aligned Length Measurement tool can also be used to place dimensions on rod and bearer (strut) snap points.  

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/2bc1db7e-1444-474f-8b52-3e2de7c6a753)

**Tips**

1.  Sometimes the tool has trouble placing the dimension in the plane you want:
    
    1.  Changing the view angle can help placement.
        
    2.  Drag the dimension over the origin point also helps set the plane.
        
2.  After selecting the two points you want to dimension between:  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/877d7e58-f4df-4472-8032-dc0fc29ef65e)
    
    1.  Press the tab key to change the direction the dimension line is measuring. When tabbing between linear dimensions will provide an immediate visual indicator that the dimension changed, namely, that the pivot symbol will re-position itself and two of the dimension lines will change to reflect the updated pivot.
        

#### Place Angular Measurement

The Place Angle Measurement tool adds snap points that will be projected into space for easy measurement between connected model elements. To use the **Place Angle Measurement** tool:

1.  Click the **Dimensioning** button and then click the **Place Angle Measurement** button.
    
2.  Hover around the starting point and click one of the snap points. In this example, I clicked the Circle on the Elbow in.
    
    1.  **Circle - Center or node of the object. Tip:** Use tab to move from one center point to the next.
        
    2.  **Diamond - Face, quadrant, or endpoint** 
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/36071237-db63-45bd-b9aa-4caf834d44b0)
        
          
    3.  **X - Intersection, angle vertex point** 
        
3.  Hover to find the vertex of the angle snap point. Click the vertex of the angle. In this example, I clicked the X.
    
4.  Hover to find the second snap point on the other side of the angle. In this example, I clicked a Circle on the Elbow out.
    
5.  Drag back and forth around the pivot element.
    
6.  When the pivot element is the position where you want to place the angle measurement, release the mouse. The angle measurement tag and legs are placed. You can move it as needed.
    

#### Tab Olet Snap Points

Olet Snap Point can be difficult to select. Tab through available Olet snap points to improve point selection in dimensioning tools. To use:

1.  Select the **Place Aligned Length Measurement** button.
    
2.  Hover over the Olet and press tab. Continue pressing the tab key until the snap point you want is selected.
    

#### Roll Angle Dimension

Use the **Place Rolling Angle Measurement** between two parts with respect to the second part selected, but set to a rolling angle. A rolling angle (clocking angles) is an angle that changes directions in all three planes. A common example is if you have an offset that changes elevation between two 45 degree angles, and you rotate it clockwise about 35 degrees, you’ll have a rolling offset. The purpose of this tool is to obtain that 35-degree roll.

1.  Click the rolling dimension button.
    
2.  Click two parts the order of which needs to be the rolling element first, and the part about which it is rolling second.
    
3.  Once the two parts are selected, a drag line will display around a pivot at the end of the reference part. This defines the plane that will be measured against.
    
4.  Click to place the Roll Angle tag. The arm that remains gives you a reference point for how the angle was created (90 - 55 = 35).
    

## Spool Checker

The **Spool Checker** tool enables users to make part cut length adjustments which are preserved after the model is imported and then republished. In addition, when parts are connected, and their dimensions are NOT locked, those dimension adjustments will impact each part. As a result, when the user adjusts the dimension for one part, that amount of length removed or added will be transferred to the other part(s). For example, if one part that is originally 4", is adjusted to 2", the connected part (9-7/16"), which is NOT locked, will receive the additional 2", making it's adjusted measurement TAG now 11-7/16". **Note:** Spool Checker will not make adjustments to parts in connected assemblies.

1.  In the Assembly Viewer using the Spool Checker, cut length adjustments can be made.
    
    1.  **Before - Original part is 4" and is connected to a part that is 9-7/16" which is not locked.**  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/e6130dd0-710c-45c6-b9b0-26e8ad4bd33d)
        
    2.  **After – Adjusted Cut length changed from 4” to 2". In addition, the 9-7/16" is adjusted to 11-7/16", both reflected in the Adj.L tags.**  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/e0c68d84-0e97-4362-a446-7fed5e88e505)
        
2.  When you use the Dimensioning > Auto-Dimension Spool Assembly tool, the Adjusted Cut Length will be labeled Adj.L: which you can compare to the original cut length (Ex. 7'0")
    
3.  The Adjusted Cut Length can be sent to your cutting tool.
    
4.  When the model is republished, the assembly's Adjusted Cut Length will be retained.
    

## Save Default Extensions

The Save Default Extensions option gives each user the ability to set the default view in the Assemblies Viewer. If want your item numbers and/or dimensions showing by default, then turn those on and then click the Save Default Extensions button.

## Assembly Tasks

If Assembly Tasks have been defined and triggered, the Assembly Tasks action bar will display. See the [**Task Definitions (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217711302 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217711302") article and the **Assign to** section for more information on configuring an Assembly Task.

1.  With the Assembly Tasks action bar, the red button label (Ex. Cut Assembly) based on the Task Definition will display.
    
2.  To change the task status to **In-progress**, click the red button once.
    
3.  To change the task status to **Complete**, click the blue button once.

See the [**File Attachment Workflow**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2081619969 "/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2081619969") for more information.

## Automatic Attachments - STRATUS Sheet PDF

After opening an assembly’s STRATUS Sheet, clicking the **PDF** button will save the PDF as an attachment and to the local computer’s download folder.

1.  Open a STRATUS Sheet and click the **PDF** button.
    
    1.  The PDF is saved as an attachment in the assembly’s Attachments tab.
        

## Automatic Attachments - Bend Instructions

Automatic attachments are attached to an assembly when the model injects the attachment into the part. For example:

1.  When using Greenlee Bender software or Conduit Studio in Revit and then publishing the model, the Bend Instructions tab will display the the bend instructions in the Bend Instructions tab and in the Attachments tab. See the [**Assembly Bend Instructions**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2189000705 "/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2189000705") for more information.
    
2.  Click the file name link (Ex. Kick 90.txt) and the instructions will display in a separate time along with a Download option. Once saved, these files can be applied at the bender.
    

## Manual Attachments

A manual attachment can be attached either by:

1.  Clicking the **Capture Image** button when the device (like a tablet) is equipped with a camera.
    
2.  Clicking the **Add Attachment** button where any file can be attached to the assembly.
    
    1.  Locate the file and then either Confirm (or change) File Name and click **OK**.
        
    2.  The file will attach.
        
3.  Attachments can also be deleted by clicking the **Delete** button.
    

## Attachment Toggle Preview

To preview an attachment (Only: .txt, .pdf, .csv, and a .jpg) in the Attachments tab.

1.  **Hover** over the attachment and the **Click to toggle preview** message will display. Notice too that the row highlights.
    
2.  Click in the row most anywhere in the area highlighted in red (above) to open the file preview.
    
3.  Click the row again to close the file preview.

    -   2.2 [Markup](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2146992129/Assembly+CAD+Sheet#Markup)

## CAD Sheet Tab

For a sheet to display on the CAD Sheet tab, one of the following must exist and the 2D sheets must be included in the active publish set specified in Revit.

**Revit: Property to Associate Sheets with Assemblies** - For a CAD Sheet to display under Assemblies > Viewer > CAD Sheet, if under Admin > Company > Setting > AutoCAD & Revit > the **Property to Associate Sheets with Assemblies** value is configured, that property value should match the sheet name to display for the assembly. If not, the assembly name should match the sheet name or the sheet name with ' - Spool' or ' - Sheet' suffix. **Note**: This setting only works with true Revit assemblies, not parameter-based assemblies.

**AutoCAD: Publish Spool Drawings -** There is also a special case for AutoCAD files, where at time of publish, if under Admin > Company > Setting > AutoCAD & Revit > the **Publish Spool Drawings** is enabled and there is a separate DWG name matching the assembly name with 2d layout view.

**HangerWorks** \- For HangerWorks assemblies, the prefix of the hanger name should match the sheet name, separated by ' - ', where we strip off the hanger Mark value and just match on the Prefab ID.

## CAD Sheet Markup

The CAD Sheet tab displays sheets created in the authoring tool. Once in STRATUS, tools can be used to Markup the sheet. Since the CAD Sheet tab is available on the Assemblies > Viewer and the Packages > Viewer, the information is consolidated in the [**Markup for PDF Assembly Attachments, PDF Package Attachments, and CAD Sheet**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2308407297 "/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2308407297") article.

A **Company Note** is a standardized note. An **Assembly Note** is specific to the assembly and cannot be applied to a different assembly or to a package.

-   1 [Notes Tab](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2147057665/Assembly+Notes#Notes-Tab)

## Notes Tab

There are 2 kinds of notes.

A **Company Note** is a standardized note defined under **Admin > Company > Notes** and displays in the Notes section of the Tag tool in the Packages Viewer and the Assemblies Viewer.

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/ece5f6f7-3a9b-4fd9-9c9c-78dee9737160#media-blob-url=true&id=b9553b88-7cbb-44f6-98c3-8214fb4b90af&collection=contentId-2147057665&contextId=2147057665&mimeType=image%2Fpng&name=image2019-8-19_11-9-25.png&size=36579&width=527&height=513&alt=)

An **Assembly Note** is specific to the assembly and cannot be applied to a different assembly or to a package. It's a one-off note. The following are the steps to add an Assembly Note to an assembly.

1.  Click the **Notes tab**, click the **New Note** button, enter the note, and save. The note will display.
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/650dd0ea-a844-4a43-b2e5-549d57c5f485#media-blob-url=true&id=a7beb9e6-dcc6-4e2e-ae6c-ade316749852&collection=contentId-2147057665&contextId=2147057665&mimeType=image%2Fpng&name=image2022-4-18_9-21-2.png&size=27865&width=951&height=277&alt=)
    
2.  To apply the note to an assembly/spool:
    
    1.  Click the **TAG** button to display the Annotation Tags dialog.
        
    2.  Under **Annotation Tags**, select **Notes**.
        
    3.  Under **Notes**, select the note.
        
    4.  To apply the note to a part, click the part. The note will display on the selected part's centroid.
        
3.  To delete a note tag:
    
    1.  **Individual tags** - Individual tags can be deleted by clicking the tag's red x.
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/d3202e04-e635-45d0-8a9c-cd78272598e8#media-blob-url=true&id=44323e6f-2884-4b0f-87bf-6b35aaae76c8&collection=contentId-2147057665&contextId=2147057665&mimeType=image%2Fpng&name=image2022-6-24_14-50-47.png&size=34959&width=575&height=313&alt=)
        
    2.  **All tag instances** - All tag instances can be deleted in the Notes data table by clicking the **Delete** button. A prompt similar to the following will display.

        -   2.10.2 [Firefox](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2144272385/Assembly+Stratus+Sheet#Firefox)

## Setup

The Stratus Sheet is a **Template** and a **Report** combination.

## Create a Template

For information on how to create a Template, see the [**Create a Report Template**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/157974589/Templates+Admin#Templates(Admin)-CreateaReportTemplate.1 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/157974589/Templates+Admin#Templates(Admin)-CreateaReportTemplate.1") article on the Templates (Admin) page. The Template will be associated with the report below.

## Create a Report

For information on how to create a Report, see the [**Report (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/200998967 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/200998967") article.

For a Report to display in the Assemblies > Viewer > Parts > Reports drop-down, the report must include the following:

-   **Format** = PDF
    
-   **Item Type** = Part 
    
-   **Template** = Any template 
    
-   **Assembly Viewer** = Checked
    
-   **Report Fields** = Valid report fields
    

## Stratus Sheet Tab

## Display a Stratus Sheet

To display a Stratus Sheet in the Assemblies > Viewer:

1.  Under **Assemblies** > **Viewer** > **Stratus Sheets** > **Report**, select the report.
    
2.  The Stratus Sheet will display. In this example, no **Dimensioning** and/or **Tags and Item Numbers** have been configured to display.
    

Adding **Dimensioning** and/or **Tags and Item Numbers** to a Stratus Sheet is a 2-step process:

1.  **View Style** - To control whether or not **Dimensions** or **Tags and Item Numbers** display on a Stratus Sheet Report:
    
    1.  Under Admin > Company > Reports, identify the Report **Template**.
        
    2.  Under Admin > Company > Templates, open the **Template**, right-click on the isometric-view or the plan-view element, click the **Select View Style** option, and identify the currently selected View Style.
        
    3.  Under Admin > Company > View Styles, locate the View Style and then configure the following:
        
        1.  **Render Dimensions** - When checked the **Render Dimensions** option will display the dimensions set in the Viewer on the Stratus Sheet report.

Task items are the instances of company-defined task definitions, which belong to task workflows optionally assigned to assemblies and parts.

-   1 [Tasks Tab](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2146995835/Assembly+Tasks#Tasks-Tab)

## Tasks Tab

Task items are the instances of company-defined task definitions, which belong to task workflows optionally assigned to assemblies and parts. Each task item knows the assembly or part to which it belongs and holds a reference to the user and/or station with start and completed time stamps. The **Task tab** is used to manage part tasks for an assembly. It works in conjunction with [**Task Definitions**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217711302/Task+Definitions+Admin "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217711302/Task+Definitions+Admin"). An operator can set the **Use Hand Scanner** option so that a hand scanner (rather than a keyboard/mouse) can be used to change task status and indicate completed work. A user must be associated with a project role that includes permission for Assemblies > Viewer > Tasks.

1.  The Task Tab only displays.
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/8fe75679-b0ae-4a31-8ec8-9baa3292a403#media-blob-url=true&id=07a7c84d-ccc0-4c0f-ab46-294f51e1a159&collection=contentId-2146995835&contextId=2146995835&mimeType=image%2Fpng&name=image2019-10-7_10-7-5.png&size=31108&width=528&height=172&alt=)
    
2.  Click the **Tasks** tab to display:
    
    1.  The list of tasks filtered based on the tasks that the assigned station (device) can perform.
        
    2.  Tasks in sequential order with buttons for Start and Finish.
        
        1.  **Red** – indicates the task has not been started.
            
        2.  **Blue** – indicates the task has been started.
            
        3.  **Green** – the task is done.
            
    3.  The table which includes the part **Number**, the part **Name**, the **Task** definition name, and the **QR code.**
        
3.  If the **Use Hand Scanner** button has been clicked, the operator can scan the QR Code to change the task status from Start to Finish. Later the operator can scan the QR Code to change the task status from Finish to Done which will result in the **Update Tracking Status** dialog. Note: The operator can also click the Start and Finish buttons to accomplish the same actions.

## Add Items to a Container

The Containers page provides several ways to select and add items to a container:

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/84a0b5ab-fb34-41cc-b1e4-144262e51f0b)

1.  **Manual** - A container can be manually selected. See the [**Manually Add Items to Container**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/188514329/Containers#HowtoManuallyAddItemstoContainer "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/188514329/Containers#HowtoManuallyAddItemstoContainer") section for more information.
    
2.  **Hand Scanner** - Use a hand scanner to scan the container's QR Code. See the [**Work with Containers Using a Hand Scanner**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/188514329/Containers#HowtoWorkwithContainersUsingaHandScanner "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/188514329/Containers#HowtoWorkwithContainersUsingaHandScanner") section for more information.
    
3.  **Tablet or Phone Camera Scan** - Use a Tablet or Phone Camera scanner to scan the container's QR Code. See the [**Work with Containers Using a Tablet or Phone Camera Scan**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/188514329/Containers#HowtoWorkwithContainersUsingaTabletorPhoneCameraScan "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/188514329/Containers#HowtoWorkwithContainersUsingaTabletorPhoneCameraScan") section for more information.
    
4.  **Package Categories > Use Containers** - A company doesn't want every package to be exposed to a Container. Under Admin > Company > [**Package Categories**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351"), uncheck the **Use Containers** checkbox so that these packages don’t display in the Containers drop-down.
    

## Add Items to Container - Manual

**To select and manually add items to a container:**

1.  Under Containers > Assign, click the **Container** drop-down.
    
2.  Select a target container. If the list of containers is long, you can limit the list of Containers by selecting the container type (Area, Basket, etc.) and a list of those container types will display.  
    
3.  With the container selected the Containers page is ready for you to manually add items to the container.
    
4.  **Exclude Contained items** - Determine whether or not you want to **Exclude Contained items** which will exclude items from the Manual Selection list if the item is contained in any container. Checking this option is a device-specific setting and will be cleared when the user unchecks the setting or when the browser cache is cleared.
    
    1.  **Unchecked (Default)** - When Unchecked, the default behavior of adding/removing items to/from the Contents of the container is that packages, assemblies, parts, and containers that have been added to the currently selected container are filtered out of the lists on the left under Manual Selection.
        
    2.  **Checked** - When checked:
        
        1.  The setting will be saved to the device's local storage.
            
        2.  The Manual Selection drop-down lists will now exclude any items that are included in any Container. In this example, parts of of Package REV-DIM-0001 have been added to Truck B.
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/3ba70e02-9896-42c9-a782-8a03738f57c8)
            
        3.  Switch to a different Container (Ex. Truck D). Since the Package still includes items that are not yet in a container, the package will still display, but the items that are included in a different container (Ex. Truck B) do not display in the list.
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/dbc929f1-5843-4178-8e2e-9a3f19f7e209)
            
5.  To add items like a part, assembly, package, or shop item to the selected container, under the Manual Selection section, identify the Project, Model, Container, and or Item that will be added to the container. 
    
6.  As you add items to the Container, the Contents will grow.
    
7.  Assembly parts can be expanded and contracted by clicking the **expander icon**
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/8fbd72a5-65a0-43d9-b633-5b195d0e590a)
    
    **.**  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/2944dfda-ca30-4315-a95e-f6f8e4d3d54b)
    
8.  **To Remove Items from the Contents of a Container**, either:
    
    1.  Click the **Remove** button to remove an individual item. After all individual items have been removed from the container, the Tracking history will remain. New items can be added to the container.
        
    2.  Click the **Empty Container** button to remove all items from the container. 
        
        1.  The prompt to remove all items from the container will display.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/1a5dc72b-e9d6-46b9-863a-b1cbfda88c15)
            
        2.  When OK is clicked, another prompt to start a new Tracking Log for the container will display.
            
            1.  **Cancel** \- Click **Cancel** to retain the Tracking entries for historical reference.
                
            2.  **OK** \- Click **OK** to delete the Tracking entries.
                
9.  To print the contents of a container, select a configured Container Details report and click the Print button. See the [**Example: Container Details Report**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393/Reports+Admin#Example%3AContainerDetailsReport "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393/Reports+Admin#Example%3AContainerDetailsReport") section for more information. A PDF will generate similar to the following:  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/903ed0d5-6ce9-4595-b2db-e212531768c7)
    
10.  You may attempt to add an item that’s already in Container A to Container B. At this time, remove the item from Container A first before adding it to Container B.
    

## Add Items to Container - Hand Scanner

### (Video 1:25)

This video demonstrates how to work with containers using a hand scanner.

<iframe allowfullscreen="" allowtransparency="true" data-hasbody="false" data-layout="default" data-local-id="e5cd346f-cb10-4e52-bfcf-ddea3fbdd220" data-macro-id="ef85ecc7-6d50-4644-8136-b2ec54cd20c6" data-macro-name="widget" frameborder="0" height="364" mozallowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="640" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/347084881?h=embed"></iframe>

**To select and add items to a container using a hand scanner:**

1.  To select a container with a Hand Scanner, go to the Containers page.
    
2.  Click the **Scan Container QR code using handheld scanner** button.
    
3.  The button will disable indicating the container's QR code is ready for you to scan.
    
4.  Before you scan, make sure the page is active or has focus. You’ll know the Containers page is not active if you scan a container’s QR code and nothing happens. If this happens, just click anywhere on the containers page to give the page focus. 
    
5.  Go ahead and scan the container QR code. Notice that the Scan Success message will display. It will disappear in 2 seconds and you can scan the next item.
    
6.  The Container and any existing contents will display.
    
7.  Once a container is selected, you can add a package, assembly, or part to the container.
    
    1.  **Add Assembly on Scan checkbox**
        
        1.  **Checked** \- If checked, when a tracking status change is made to any part contained in an assembly, the change will automatically apply to all parts in the assembly and to the assembly itself.
            
        2.  **Unchecked** \- If unchecked, when a tracking status change is made to any part contained in an assembly, the change will not be applied to the any other parts or to the assembly.
            
8.  Click the **Scan item QR codes to add to container using Handheld scanner** button and then scan the QR code.
    
9.  The scanned item will display in the Contents list. Note that the Assembly or Package name is a hyperlink. The Assembly's link goes to the Assemblies Viewer and the Package's link goes to the tab you have set as the default for packages.
    
10.  If you scan an item that has already been scanned, the item will not be added to the container's contents list and you will be prompted to remove the item from the other container.
    

### Scan Errors

Scanned code was not in the expected format

If the message below displays when scanning a QR code on the Containers > Assign tab, it means that scanned content is case sensitive. To fix the issue, find a scanner setting that does not edit the text (Ex. changing text to all caps).

## Add Items to Container - Tablet or Phone Camera Scanner

**To select and add items to a container using a tablet or phone camera scanner:**

1.  Click the **Scan Container QR code using camera** button.

    2.  The camera is ready to scan the QR code.
        
    3.  Position the device’s camera so that the QR code can be read.
        
4.  The device will scan the container label as soon as it can read the QR code. There’s no need to click any button to scan the QR code.
    
      
    As soon as the QR code is read, a Scan Successful popup message will display. This message will display for 2 seconds giving you time to move the scanner away from the current QR code.
    
5.  The Container and any existing contents will display.
    
6.  Once a container is selected, you can add a package, assembly, or part to the container.
    
7.  Click the **Scan item QR codes to add to container using Camera** button and then scan the QR code.
    
    1.  The correct camera should still be active.
        
8.  Position the device’s camera until the QR code is read.
    
9.  The **Scan Successful** popup message will display, and the scanned item will display in the Contents list.
    
10.  This message will display for 2 seconds giving you time to move the scanner away from the current QR code.
    
11.  The camera is ready to scan the next QR code.
    
12.  If you scan an item that has already been scanned, the item will not be added to the container's contents list and you will be prompted to remove the item from the other container.

    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/bbdf14d9-f86a-42d3-abd8-54d7fe9ae225)
    

## Container Tracking Log Entry

A Container Tracking log entry is made whenever a package, assembly, part, or container is added to or removed from a container and when a container or container contents are moved to another container. This feature provides customers with either a permanent container tracking history or a history that is temporary and can be cleared. **Note**: The contents of a nested container will not be updated.

Container events (add, remove, empty) are logged in the applicable container, package, assembly, and part’s tracking log, so the history of what happened related to a container is transparent. The Contents column displays the contents of the container at the time of the event. Updates will be visible in the following locations:

1.  **Container Tracking**
    
2.  **Package Tracking**
    
3.  **Assembly Tracking**
    
4.  **Part Property**
    
5.  **QR Code Scanned page (Assembly example)**
    

## Add Container A to Container B (Sub-container)

If a container is included within another container, the sub-container can be managed (Empty Container and Remove Item) as if it were the selected container so that the user does not have to switch between containers.

In the example below, items were added to the Hanger Box container and then the Hanger Box container was added to the Truck D container.

1.  **Parent Container section**
    
    1.  **Parent Container** - The parent container is the container selected in the Container drop-down.
        
    2.  **Empty Container** button - Click the **Empty Container** button associated with Truck D to empty the container of all items.
        
    3.  **Remove** item button - Click the **Remove** button to remove individual items from the parent container.
        
2.  **Containers sub-section**
    
    1.  **Sub-container** - A sub-container displays after a container is added to the parent container.
        
    2.  **Remove sub-container Hanger Box** button - Click the **Remove sub-container Hanger Box** button to remove the Hanger Box sub-container from the Truck D parent container. The container will be removed from Truck D.
        
    3.  **Empty Container** button - Click the **Empty Container** button associated with sub-container to empty the sub-container of all items. **Note**: All items will also be removed from the sub-container when it is selected as the parent container.
        
    4.  **Remove** item button - Click the **Remove** button to remove individual items from the sub-container.
        

## Reports

## Container

A Container report includes information about the container, not the contents of the container. Before a Container label can be printed, it must be configured.

-   See the [**Example: Container Label Report**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393/Reports+Admin#Example%3AContainerLabelReport "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393/Reports+Admin#Example%3AContainerLabelReport") section for more information.
    
-   To Print Container Label, see the [**Print Container Label**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/246317057/Containers+Admin#Print-Container-Label "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/246317057/Containers+Admin#Print-Container-Label") section.
    
-   To see a list of [**STRATUS.Container.\***](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/598868043/STRATUS.+Parameters+and+Properties#STRATUS.Container.* "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/598868043/STRATUS.+Parameters+and+Properties#STRATUS.Container.*") fields that can be used as Container fields on report.
    

A Container Label can be printed from:

1.  The Containers (Admin) page or from the [**Containers**](http://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/188514329/Containers "http://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/188514329/Containers") page by clicking the Print Labels button.
    
2.  The Containers page by clicking the Print Labels button.
    

## Container Details

A Container Details report includes the contents of a container, not information about the container. A Container Details report is run from the Container’s page. Before a Container report can be generated, it must be configured. See the [**Example: Container Details Report**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393/Reports+Admin#Example%3AContainerDetailsReport "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393/Reports+Admin#Example%3AContainerDetailsReport") section for more information.

## Scan and Report Mode

Scan and Report Mode is a feature that streamlines the process of adding items to multiple containers and then generating a report with minimal interaction on the Containers Assign page.

To setup this feature:

1.  Select the Report that should be generated when the process of adding items to the container is complete. In this example, the Container Details report is selected which is the Bill of Lading.
    
2.  Open the first container.
    
3.  Click the **Scan and Report Mode** button. It will turn from green to blue to indicate it is active. With the feature ready to use scan items into the container.
    
4.  Scan items into the container. In this example, 1 assembly and 4 loose parts are added to the container.
    
5.  When done with this container, scan the next container QR code.
    
6.  As the next container populates the Assign tab, the selected report will automatically generate in a separate window for the existing container. The report might need to be manually printed.
    
7.  Continue to scan items into the newly selected container. 4 assemblies will be scanned into this container and each includes a tracking log entry.
    
8.  When done, scan the next container QR code.
    
9.  The report will generate.
    
10.  Repeat this process of scanning and generating a container report as needed. To end the Scan and Report Mode, click the **Scan and Report Mode** button. It will turn back to green.
    

## Scan the Container QR Code

Scan the Container QR Code to review the container's contents and update the Tracking Status.

To scan a container's QR Code:

1.  Print a Container Label.
    
2.  Scan the QR Code to display the **Container QR Code Scanned** landing page where the Contents of the Container can be expanded, emptied, and the status of the container can be updated which changes the status of the packages, assemblies, and parts within the container.
    
3.  To Add Images or Attachments to a Tracking Status update:
    
    1.  Click the **Capture Image** or the **Add Attachments** button to add an image or attachment to the tracking status update.

## Create New Package

A built-in package Lead Days feature was added to Stratus on 8/7/2021 that offers calculated default Start Dates for package phases. With this change, those who create Packages must set the **Required Date** in relation to a Package **Phase**. Phases are also used in [**Division (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103317524 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103317524") and [**Tracking Statuses (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761"). See the [**Added Lead Days and Start Date Properties to Packages**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1662813138#Added-Lead-Days-and-Start-Date-Properties-to-Packages "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1662813138#Added-Lead-Days-and-Start-Date-Properties-to-Packages") section for more information.

Below are the package Phases in relation to Lead Days:

-   **Office** \- Detailing Start Date
    
-   **Purchasing** \- Purchasing Start Date
    
-   **Shop** \- Fabrication Start Date
    
-   **Field** (Default) - Required On-site Date
    

**To create a package in the Models Viewer or Packages Viewer:**

1.  Before creating a package:
    
    1.  The **Package Name** and **Package Number** should be configured under [**Naming Conventions**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913").
        
    2.  One or more **Package Categories** should be configured under [**Package Categories**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351").
        
2.  Go to **Models** > **Viewer** > **Actions** > **Packages** > **New**. You can also create a new package under **Packages** > **Dashboard** > **New Package**. The new package dialog and package name fields, similar to the following, will display.
    
    1.  **Category (Required)** - Select the package Category. See the [**Package Categories (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351") article for more information.
        
    2.  **Number** and **Name** - The package **Number** and **Name** will be filled-in automatically if you have configured [**Naming Conventions**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913"). You can overwrite any field value, however, each package name must be unique.
        
    3.  **Description (Optional)** \- Enter a Description as needed.
        
    4.  **Hours Estimated (Optional)** \- Enter Hours Estimated as needed.
        
    5.  **Phase (Required)** - Select a package Phase.
        
        1.  **Field (Default)** - Field is selected by default which is equivalent to how packages have has always been created. The Field Phase Required Date is the Start Date that the package materials are required to be on-site and ready for fieldwork to begin.
            
        2.  **Office, Purchasing, Shop** - Select the Phase for packages that need a Start Date for Office, Purchasing, or Shop work to begin. If Lead Days have been configured for the Phase and Category, then Phase Start Dates, including the Field Required Date will be calculated. If Lead Days have not been configured, then all Phases will have the same Start Date.
            
    6.  **Required Date** - Enter a **Required Date** for the selected Phase. The Required Date may or may not be calculated depending on which Phase is selected and which Lead Day settings have been configured.
        
        1.  **Field (Default)** - If Phase = Field, then the Required Date on the Packages Dashboard (Default Report) will be set to the Required Date. See the screenshot below.
            
        2.  **Office, Purchasing, Shop** - If Phase = Office, Purchasing, or Shop, then the Required Date on the Packages Dashboard (Default Report) will be calculated based on Lead Day settings.
            
            1.  **Lead Days configured** - If Lead Days have been configured for the Phase and selected Category, then the Required Date displayed on the Packages Dashboard will be calculated.
                
            2.  **Lead Days not configured** - If no Lead Days have been configured for the Phase and selected Category, then the Required Date displayed on the Packages Dashboard will be the Required Date and all Phases will have the same Start Date.
                
            3.  See the [**Added Lead Days and Start Date Properties to Packages**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1662813138#Added-Lead-Days-and-Start-Date-Properties-to-Packages "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1662813138#Added-Lead-Days-and-Start-Date-Properties-to-Packages") section for more information.

    7.  **BIM Area** - Stratus will attempt to assign a BIM Area to the Package. 
        
        1.  The BIM Area option list displays in the New Package dialog.
            
        2.  **Notes:**
            
            1.  The BIM Area assignment will **not** update the Stratus.Part.BIMArea property which is the BIM Area associated with the part.  
                
                ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/50282587-e5ae-4292-89a1-286d8fc476c3)
                
            2.  The BIM Area assignment will only update the Stratus.Package.BIMAreaPath property which can be included on a Packages Dashboard report (BIM Area below). **Note**: The Stratus.Package.BIMAreaPath is editable on the Packages Dashboard.  
                
                ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/09a4656e-6c70-4e47-9793-859e63739bf5)
                
        3.  **BIM Area Selection**

3.  Click **Save Package** when done. A package similar to the following will be saved. Parts and assemblies can now be added to or removed from the package.
    
4.  Information about packages displays on the **Packages** > **Dashboard**.
    
5.  New packages are automatically added to the **Packages** > **Schedule**. 
    

## Add Parts and Assemblies to a Package - Model Viewer

If parts were not selected while create a New Package, parts or assemblies can be added to the package. There are several ways to add parts or assemblies to a package.  Note: Before adding parts or assemblies to a package, the package must be in a "**Can Package**" tracking status. See the [**Tracking Statuses**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761") page for more information. For example, if a package is the "Shipped" tracking status, it's not a good practice to edit the package by adding a part or assembly to it.

To add parts and assemblies to a package:

1.  In the **Models** > **Viewer**, click **Actions** > **Packages** and select your target package.
    
2.  In the **Models** > **Viewer**, **Filter** the model as needed.
    
    1.  If everything isolated in view will be added to the package, click the **\+ Isolated Assemblies/Parts** button. The isolated elements will be added to the package. 
        
    2.  If, you selected parts and assemblies, click the + Selected **Assemblies/Parts** button. The selected elements will be added to the package. 
        
3.  Once added to a package, parts, and assemblies will display on the Package's **Items** tab. 
    
4.  There is an art to isolating and selecting items in the Models Viewer. For information on different ways to add/remove elements to/from a package, see the Create Package video on this page. Some techniques like the Select Connected tool and Auto-Assembly tool rely on a good model where all parts are connected.

## Assembly Management

### Create Assembly

A Stratus assembly can be created:

-   During the model publish process when an assembly had been created in the model and where within Stratus under Admin > Company > Settings > the Assembly Conflict Resolution for Revit or AutoCAD is set to AutoCAD is always right, Revit is always right, or Prompt User and AutoCAD or Revit is selected. See the [**Settings (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10518994 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10518994") for more information.
    
-   **Under Models > Viewer > Actions > Assemblies**
    
-   **Under Packages > Viewer > Actions > Assemblies**
    

In the latter 2 cases, the Actions > Assemblies feature displays and functions the same and there is a manual and [**Auto Assemblies**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=65634315#CreateandManageAssemblies-AutoAssemblies "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=65634315#CreateandManageAssemblies-AutoAssemblies") option. Most companies create assemblies after creating packages. 

**Note:** Before an assembly is created, deleted, or edited check that the assembly, package or the targeted parts in the model are in a **Can Assemble Tracking Status**. See the [**Tracking Statuses (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761") article for more information.

**To create a new assembly using the Actions > Assemblies feature:**

1.  In the Models or Packages Viewer select Actions > Assemblies. The Assemblies dialog will display.
    
2.  Optionally, under Filters > Assemblies, click the **Unassigned Parts** checkbox to help identify which parts are not yet in an assembly. The parts in the viewer will be filtered. 
    
3.  Select the parts to be added to the new assembly and then click **New**, or vice versa. The Assembly naming fields configured under Admin > Company > Naming and Numbering > Naming Conventions > Assembly Naming will display and populate based on the parts selected. See the [**Naming and Numbering (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913") article for more information.
    
    1.  **Name** - To override any of the naming fields, click the Name checkbox. 
        
4.  When done, click **Save Assembly** button. The following displays:
    
    1.  The Assembly is created and its name displays in the Actions panel and in the Filters panel.
        
    2.  In the Actions panel, the assembly name is also a link to open the assembly in the Assemblies Viewer. See the [**Assemblies Viewer**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8749081 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8749081") article for more information.
        
    3.  If the Unassigned Parts checkbox is checked, the parts will have disappeared from the viewer.
        
    4.  The assembly displays on the Assemblies Dashboard.
        
    5.  **Note** : When creating an EMPTY assembly in the Packages Viewer, the assembly takes on the status of the Package/Parts being added. 
        

### Delete Assembly

A Stratus assembly can be deleted:

-   During the model publish process where an assembly has been deleted in the model and where within Stratus under Admin > Company > Settings > the Assembly Conflict Resolution for Revit or AutoCAD is set to AutoCAD is always right, Revit is always right, or Prompt User and AutoCAD or Revit is selected. See the [**Settings (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10518994 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10518994") for more information.
    
-   **Under Assemblies > Dashboard** - See the [**Assemblies Dashboard**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8912924 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8912924") article for more information.
    
-   **Under Packages > Items** - See the [**Package Items**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166658049 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166658049") article for more information.
    

**Note:** Before an assembly is created, deleted, or edited check that the assembly, package or the targeted parts in the model are in a **Can Assemble Tracking Status**. See the [**Tracking Statuses (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761") article for more information.

### Add / Remove Assembly Parts

Assembly parts can be added and removed:

-   During the model publish process when an assembly had been edited in the model and where within Stratus under Admin > Company > Settings > the Assembly Conflict Resolution for Revit or AutoCAD is set to AutoCAD is always right, Revit is always right, or Prompt User and AutoCAD or Revit is selected. See the [**Settings (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10518994 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10518994") for more information.
    
-   **Under Packages > Viewer > Actions > Assemblies**
    
-   **Under Models > Viewer > Actions > Assemblies**
    

In the latter 2 cases, the Actions > Assemblies feature displays and functions the same. 

**Packages > Viewer > Actions > Assemblies - Add / Remove parts for an existing assembly** 

1.  Open the package that contains the assembly in the Packages > Viewer.
    
2.  Locate the assembly.
    
    1.  Optionally, open the Filters > Assemblies and check the target assembly checkbox.
        
    2.  Optionally, open the Filters > Assemblies and check the Unassigned Parts checkbox.
        
3.  Select one or more parts to add/remove. In this example, a part to add has been selected. The Add Selected and Remove Selected buttons become enabled.
    
    1.  **Add** - Click the **Add Selected** button. The parts will be added to the assembly.
        
    2.  **Remove** - Click the **Remove Selected** button. The parts will be removed from the assembly.
        

**Models > Viewer > Actions > Assemblies - Add / Remove parts for an existing assembly** 

**Tips**:

-   Once an assembly is selected in the viewer, press the F key to zoom/focus onto the assembly.
    
-   To select a part that is included in an assembly, hover over the part, press tab, and then click the left mouse to select the individual part.
    

1.  Open the **Models > Viewer > Actions > Assemblies** and use one of the following methods to select the assembly. 
    
    1.  Select the assembly in the drop-down under **Actions > Assemblies.**
        
    2.  Select the assembly in the **Models > Viewer.**
        
    3.  Open **Filters > Assemblies,** check the assembly, and then select the assembly in the **Models > Viewer**.
        
2.  To add one or more parts to the assembly, select the part(s) (not in the assembly) to be added to the assembly.
    
    1.  Click the **Add Selected** button. The parts will be added to the assembly.
        
3.  To remove one or more parts from the assembly, select the part(s) (in the assembly).
    
    1.  Click the **Remove Selected** button. The parts will be removed from the assembly.
        

## Tracking Status for Newly Created Assembly

A newly created assembly will be assigned the first tracking status where the **Applies to Assembly** checkbox is checked. The parts in the assembly will be assigned the first tracking status in the list because parts can belong to multiple packages in different categories and customers have stated that they don't want the part status to immediately change.

In this example:

1.  Under Admin > Company > Tracking Statuses, the first tracking status whose **Applies to Assembly** checkbox is checked is **Issued**.
    
2.  As a result, when a new assembly is created:
    
    1.  The **assembly tracking status** will be Issued.
        
    2.  The **tracking status of parts in the assembly** will be Design, the first tracking status in the list.

## Auto Assemblies

1.  The Auto Assemblies or Continuous Spooling feature is included in the Model Viewer and Package Viewer under **Actions** > **Assemblies**. This feature enables users to start spooling by selecting one part and then through a series of clicks, tell Stratus when the spool ends and where the next one begins.
    
2.  To use the Auto Assemblies feature, check the following:
    
    1.  Be sure the system you want to auto assemble is connected. Click the **Selected Connected** tool and then click a part in the system. If the connected system turns to blue (selected) then Auto Assemblies will work. If not, discuss the connection issue with the modeler. 
        
    2.  Make sure that **Assembly Selection** and **Multiple Part Selection** options are unchecked.
        
    3.  Make sure that no parts are selected.
        
    4.  When clicking parts avoid selecting couplings and welds as Stratus ignores these parts.
        
3.  To keep track of which parts have been added to an assembly, it is recommended that Display Modes for Assemblies be selected. The Display Modes button remains green after the panel is closed indicating that it is active and parts added to assemblies will change color.
    
4.  To use the Auto Assemblies tool in the Models Viewer or Package Viewer, go to **Actions** > **Assemblies** and click the **Auto Assemblies** button. 
    
5.  The dialog switches to **Set Start** and **Finish**. In addition, the assembly naming convention configured by the administrator will display.
    
    1.  **Set Start** - The purpose of the **Set Start** button is to clear the spool start number and allows you to start spooling with a clean slate. You don’t have to use this button, but is can be useful when you start spooling a separate system or a branch.
        
    2.  **Finish** - The purpose of the **Finish** button is to close out the continuous spool command. While the continuous spool command is active it watches the clicks and generates the assemblies.
        
6.  To start the process, click the **Set Start** button. Go ahead and zoom in to select the starting part that will be included in the first assembly. Once selected, notice the following in the assembly naming section:
    
    1.  The message loading **BIM Areas** displays indicating that a part was selected.
        
    2.  The naming convention fields can be populated.
        
    3.  A **Spool Start** number is displayed.
        
7.  **Click the end part** of the first assembly. As the assembly is being created, the red bar displays.
    
8.  Once the assembly is created:
    
    1.  The red bar disappears.
        
    2.  The parts in between the first and last part selected will change color if Display Modes > Assemblies is active.
        
    3.  The **Spool Start** number changes to a new number indicating that the next connected part is set to be the first part in the next assembly.
        
9.  Since the first part in the next assembly is automatically selected, to create the next assembly, only the end part of the second assembly needs to be clicked. Like before, wait for the red bar to go away, the Spool Start number to change, and the in between parts to change color.
    
10.  Continue clicking the next end part and wait for the color to change. You can zoom and pan during this process without impacting the Auto Assemblies workflow.
    
11.  With the last part in this connected run added to an assembly, **Spool Start** is now blank and with no part selected the naming convention returns to default.
    
12.  If done auto assembling, click the **Finish** button. If there are other branches that need to be assembled, repeat the process from step 6 if the **Set Start** and **Finish** buttons are still in the Assemblies panel, otherwise, start from the beginning.
    
13.  Created assemblies display in all the usual places including under Display Modes > Assemblies, Filters > Assemblies, Assemblies Dashboard, and Packages > Dashboard > Items to name a few.
    

## Clear Assembly Button

1.  Under **Models** > **Actions** > **Assemblies**, a button has been added to clear the assembly selector which will make it easier to select a spool and edit it.
    
2.  For example, when you select an assembly under Models > Actions > Assemblies, Stratus thinks you want to add or remove parts from the assembly. But, let’s say you just want to clear the selected assembly.
    
3.  Now you can click the button next to the currently selected assembly.
    
4.  The Assemblies panel will clear and be set to NONE.
    

## Create Assembly in Revit

The GTP Stratus Add-in for Revit, in addition to the Publish and Import commands, also provides a **Create Assembly** option that gives you the ability to spool in Revit using the Stratus naming conventions defined by your company administrator. This is a good option for those who prefer to spool inside Revit.

**To use the Create Assembly option:**

1.  Open a model in Revit.
    
2.  Select items to be included in a spool or assembly.
    
3.  Under Add-Ins > GTP Stratus, click the **Create Assembly** button. The Stratus Create Assembly dialog will display.
    
4.  Hover over a field to see which information should be entered. When assemblies are created within Stratus, these fields are populated automatically.
    
5.  When done, click save and the assembly will be created. 
    
6.  Once the model is published, the assembly will be visible in Stratus.
    

## Remove Item From Assembly when the Assembly is part of a Package

-   If you have created a package
    
-   And, the package includes an assembly of parts
    
-   And then, you remove one or more parts from an assembly
    
-   The part will be listed as separate part in the package. Here’s an example where the 2 parts were removed from one of the above assemblies.
    

## Move a Single Part to a Different Assembly

To move a single part from one assembly to another assembly:

1.  The target assembly and the assembly that contains the part being moved must be in a **tracking status** where **Can Assemble** **is checked**.
    
2.  Under **Actions** > **Assemblies**, select the target assembly.
    
3.  In the model, **hover** over the part that you want to move to a different assembly, press the **Tab** key, and the **click** the part. This should select the part, not the entire assembly.
    
4.  Click the **Add Selected Parts to Assembly** button.
    
5.  Click **OK** at the “**Move Parts From One Assembly To Another?”** prompt.
    
6.  The assembly and parts will be moved.
    

## Can Package Unchecked

When parts have been added to a package, and the package's tracking status is set to one where Can Package unchecked (Ex. Issued below), it also means that parts within the package cannot be added to an Assembly. This is true even if the tracking status has Can Assemble checked. Can Package being unchecked means that no changes can be made to the package.

## Unique Assembly Instances in Revit

A Shared Family parameter can be added to a parts family will force unique instances of assemblies in Revit. This is the same way Victaulic overcomes Revit’s feature that automatically creates multiple instances of a named assembly type. By including this shared parameter in Revit for pipe fittings, couplings, and welds for example, you can force separate assemblies when using Stratusfor Revit. 

**To use this feature:**

1.  Open a model.
    
2.  Create Shared Parameter under **Manage** > **Shared Parameters** > **New**
    
    1.  **Name**: Schedule Assembly Name
        
    2.  **Discipline**: Common
        
    3.  **Type of Parameter**: Text
        
3.  Double click and open a part.
    
4.  Click **Modify > Family Types > New Parameter > Shared Parameter > select the Schedule Assembly Name created above.**  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/6fdd7389-deb4-4989-84ff-46b1c9fed3f8)
    
    1.  Select **Instance parameter**.
        
5.  **Save** the family file.
    
6.  Go back to main model.
    
7.  **Insert** > **Load Family** > Family file just created.
    
8.  Next time a model is published using this shared parameter it will include unique instances of assemblies.

## Deliverable Settings

## Company Deliverable Definitions

The first step in creating a project deliverable is to create company level **Deliverable Definition** which can be applied to any project under Admin > Company > Deliverable Definition. See the [**Deliverables Definitions (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/255393797 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/255393797") article for more information.

## Project Areas

Project deliverables are dependent on configured project Project Areas (Package Per Area Breakdown). The Package "Per Area Breakdown" number depends on the number of hierarchical areas defined in the project. For example, an AutoCAD model by default might only have the building as an area, whereas a Revit model might include a more granular hierarchical breakdown by Level, Scope Box, Room, etc. See the [**Areas (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742") article for more information.

The Deliverables page uses the Sort set on the Areas page. 

**To sort Deliverables:**

1.  Open the Projects > Areas page. On this page, the project model is imported, area abbreviations set, Range settings adjusted, and more. See the [**Areas (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742") article for more information.
    
2.  The Areas data can be sorted by Name or Elevation.
    
    1.  Click the **Sort by Name** button.
        
    2.  Or, click the **Sort by Elevation** button.
        
3.  Once the sort order is set, refresh the Projects > Deliverables page. The sort order will be the same as the Areas page.
    
    1.  Sort by Name (left) vs.  Sort by Elevation (right):
        

## Company Package Categories

A Package Category enables company's to create different packages for different purposes like Office, Purchasing, Shop, and Field work. See the [**Package Categories (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351") article for more information.

## Project Deliverables Settings

Project Deliverables leverage the Company [**Deliverable Definition**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/213123080 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/213123080") (**Deliverable and Grouping**), the Company [**Package Categories**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351") (**Package Category**), the [**Project Areas**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742") (**Package Per Area Breakdown**), and limit the Deliverable to a specific model (**Models**). Once a company Deliverable Definition, Package Category, and Project Areas have been defined, then a **Project Deliverable** can be defined. A Project Deliverable breaks out all parts defined by the company Deliverable Definition which includes a part filter, Project Areas, and then applies a Package Category to those parts. In addition, the Deliverable is limited to a specific model. Package are not created at this time but are ready to be generated under the Projects > Deliverables tab as needed.

**To create a Project Deliverable:**

1.  On the Projects > Deliverables page, click the **Project Deliverables Settings** gear icon 
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/864dbe11-65d7-4e88-8ee7-aaa793e06fa9)
    
    .  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/1266e3d9-b6a1-47df-a046-be1fd87c5912)
    
2.  A **Project Deliverables Settings** dialog similar to the following will display.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/14cdcf14-a564-402f-a62d-728eef7c48a2)
    
3.  Click **New Deliverable**.
    
    1.  **Deliverable** – Select the company level Deliverable Definition previously defined under Admin > Company > Deliverables which includes the part filter.
        
    2.  **Package Category** – Select the package category that parts and assemblies will be assigned to once the deliverable is used to generate a package.
        
    3.  **Package Per Area Breakdown** – Select the smallest sub-area for which packages will be created. For example, you might want packages created for an entire level. Or, you might want packages created for sub-areas of a level. This setting depends on the hierarchy of how your building areas have been broken down under the Areas tab. Remember, your Deliverable Definition filter will determine which parts (Ex. Hangers, Pipe, Duct) are included in the package.
        
    4.  **Models** - A model must be associated with each Deliverable.
        

## Generate Project Deliverables

The **Projects > Deliverables** page is where Deliverables (project packages) are generated. Before generating packages, you can review the Area and Package Category, as well as the number of Parts and Assemblies that will be packaged.

**To generate Deliverables:**

1.  **Area Selection Filter** – Select project areas to be used for Deliverables. The filter displays the project and sub-areas in a hierarchical format as defined under Project > Areas. For each checked Area, when the Auto or Re-Generate Deliverables button is clicked, deliverables will be created for those areas. Use the **Deliverables without area checkbox** when the model parts did not have an area (Ex. Stratus.Part.BIMArea).
    
2.  **Generate Deliverables** - Click the **Generate Deliverables** button. The **Generate Deliverables** dialog will display. This dialog requires that you to limit the deliverables generated to the selected model(s), Deliverable Definitions and Package Category(s). Use the **Select All models** checkbox to quickly select all project models. Use the **Search** to search for a string in the model name, not the deliverable definition or the package category.
    
3.  Click **Continue** and the Deliverables will display by Model, Area, Name, and Package Category. In addition, information about the Parts, Assemblies, and Total Parts included for each package will display.
    
    1.  **Model** - The **model** associated with the deliverable will display.
        
    2.  **Area** - The **area** associated with the deliverable will display.
        
    3.  **Name** - The **deliverable definition** associated with the deliverable will display.
        
    4.  **Group** - The **group** is associated with Deliverable Definition Filter and the Filter's Grouping's Property Name under Admin > Company > Groupings.  Filters break out the packages and Groupings further break out packages by Property. 
        
    5.  **Package Category** - The **package category** selected for the deliverable under Project Deliverables Settings
        
    6.  **Package** - Package will initially be empty until a package is generated. 
        
    7.  **Required Date** - The **Required Date** will initially be empty until a package is generated. 
        
    8.  **Package Status** - Package Status will initially be empty until a package is generated. 
        
    9.  **Parts** - The number of loose parts in the deliverable.
        
    10.  **Assemblies** - The number of assemblies in the deliverable.
        
    11.  **Total Parts** - The number of total parts (loose parts + parts in assemblies) in the deliverable.
        

## Dismiss Warnings

Since a Project Deliverable combines a model, filter, and BIM area, when any of these are edited, a warning message displays alerting you to review the impact of changes on your Deliverables. The warning messages do not prevent you from using the Deliverables page. You can dismiss individual warning messages or click the **Dismiss all All Warnings** button.

## Manage Packages

One or more packages can be created and deleted from the Deliverables page.

## Select Deliverables

**To select deliverables, do one of the following:**

1.  **Click one or more checkboxes** - Click one or more checkboxes associated with each deliverable row. For example, with these 3 selected, the buttons to **Generate 3 Packages** or **Delete 3 Deliverables** become enabled.

      to generate a package for the selected deliverable.  The Deliverable will convert into a package and as a result, the package will also display on the Packages > Dashboard (not shown).
4.  **Check Deliverable row** – Check the checkbox associated with the deliverable row and the options to **Generate # Packages** and **Delete # Deliverables** will display. Either click the Generate # Packages button to generate multiple packages or, click the Delete # Deliverables button to remove the selected deliverables from the Deliverables page. A deliverable can also be deleted by clicking the Delete button associated with the Deliverable.
    
5.  Once one or more packages have been created, the package(s) will display on the **Packages > Dashboard** and can follow the same workflow as other packages created from the Models > Viewer > Actions > Packages dialog.

> The Jobsites page is a management dashboard for each Station's work queue when the Station's Division is set to a Jobsite Division.

---
The Jobsites page is a management dashboard for each Station's work queue when the Station's Division is set to a Jobsite Division.  
![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/170819638/image2020-7-13_16-34-47.png?version=1&modificationDate=1594676088295&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1195&height=250)

The Jobsites page enables a Shop Foreman role to manage queued items and send them to a tool on demand. Queued items include the number of Cut Lists, Point Lists, and/or Tasks for each package.

-   **Cut Lists** are generated from the Package's > Cut Lists tab.
-   **Point Lists** are generated from the Package's > Point Lists tab.
-   **Tasks** are generated from a package's Task Workflows.

**To access the Jobsites page:**

1.  Click the **Jobsites** menu item.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/170819638/image2019-9-18_14-38-34.png?version=1&modificationDate=1568835515480&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=895&height=322)
2.  Click the **Station** name to display when the queued item was requested, the project name, the package name, number of items and status.

2.  Click the Model name to open the model in the Models > Viewer. **Note**: In this example, the Default Report is displaying. 
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/e8379774-dea0-4203-b21e-13ea4867e268)
    

## Open Package from the Containers > Dashboard

Once a package has been added to a container, it will display under Containers > Dashboard.

1.  From the Containers > Dashboard, expand a Container to which a package has been added.
    
2.  Click the model name to open the model in a separate browser window. 
    
3.  The model will display with the Project and Model selected. 
    

## Models Viewer Navigation

## View

During the model publish process, a **Default 3D View** will be selected. This view will display in the Models > Viewer. For users who have permission, the View can be manually changed in Stratus. The View drop-down can display different published views. When a 2D View is selected, the Stratus Toolbar is disabled.

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/0ecba615-ae42-4409-ab71-51f7eb3613ba)

## Selected Part Tracking Status

When parts are selected in the Models > Viewer, their Tracking Status and number will display. For example:

1.  **Selected Parts have the same Tracking Status** - When the selected parts have the same tracking status (Ex. Packaged), the tracking status and the number of parts (Ex. 3) selected will display.
    
2.  **Selected Parts have different Tracking Status** - When the selected parts have different tracking status (Ex. Design), the tracking status’s and the number of parts selected (Ex. 1) in each will display.
    
3.  **Note**: For tablet users or those running in mobile mode, this feature is not supported. The hamburger icon displays when in mobile mode.
    

## Models Viewer Settings

Click the gear icon to access the viewer's **Settings**. See the [**Viewer Settings and Search**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2011136001 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2011136001") article for more information.  

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/2040bb32-94a2-49e3-9f55-9ef7ce757c37)

Settings in the Models > Viewer include the following:

-   **Hidden Parts Shaded**
    
-   **Assembly Selection**
    
-   **Multiple Part Selection**
    
-   **Dynamic Tags**
    
-   **Decimal Inches / Feet Inches Toggle**
    

## Viewer Search for Parts, Assemblies, and Packages

Click the Search icon to access viewer **Search**. See the [**Viewer Settings and Search**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2011136001 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2011136001") article for more information.

The Stratus Model Viewer Toolbar includes some handy tools. The Stratus Toolbar is also used on the Packages > Viewer and the Assemblies > Viewer. Unless specified, the tools function the same across all viewers.

## Display Modes

1.  **Display Modes** – Model parts can be color coded by several modes including Areas, Assemblies, Categories, Containers, Packages, Tracking, and Purchasing. Click **Normal** to return to a non-color coded display mode.  Displays Modes also work when Stratus Toolbar > Filters have been applied in the Viewer. Only items that include parts display in the results.
    
    1.  **Parts** 
        
        1.  Each mode displays information about the total number and percent of parts in these categories. Any filters applied to the view will impact these values. Below is an example where Display Mode is set to Areas.
            
    2.  **Regions**
        
        1.  A Region is a 3d polygon outline over the full region. For Regions to display, BIM Areas must be defined for the model.  In this example, there are Revit Rotated Scope Boxes.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/7a9cfd3b-2862-4ea6-8cfd-da1f5f16a201)
            
        2.  After the model is publish and BIM Areas defined, the scope boxes display within Regions.
            

## Filters

### Company Filter Cache

To improve performance, Company filters are cached on the server. 

Caching is initiated by the first user who opens the Filters > Company dialog. As a result, the first user to open Filters > Company in a model will notice the time it takes to calculate all the filters. Subsequently, users who open Filters > Company for the model will notice that the filters display within seconds. The Filters > Company cache will be purged and recalculated each time any of the following occurs, and, as a result, the first user to load the viewer webpage and open Filters > Company will wait for the recalculation to repopulate the cache.

Filters > Company will purge and recalculate after any of the following events:

-   When a Company **Filter** is edited under Admin > Company > Filters where Model Viewer is checked.
    
-   When an **Alias**, **Field**, or **Grouping** that is directly referenced by a company filter is modified.

### Filter Descriptions

1.  Filters are used to slice and dice the model the way you want to view it. Filters include:
    
    1.  **Areas** – Areas can be imported from the model or manually entered by the Stratus Admin.  See the [**Areas (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742") article for how to configure areas from the model.
        
    2.  **Assemblies** – An assembly can be defined in the model or within Stratus under Actions.
        
    3.  **Categories** – Cost Categories are defined by the Stratus Admin.
        
    4.  **Company** – Company filters can be configured by the Stratus Admin. Filter categories will not display when no parts match the filter.
        
    5.  **Containers** - Packages, Assemblies, and Parts added to a Container display in the Containers filter. See the [**Containers Assign**](http://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1877574151 "http://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1877574151") article for more information. The Containers Filter displays a tree structure broken out by Container Type and then containers. In this example, there are 2 Container Types, Cart and Truck. There are 2 trucks and the Container page for Truck B displays on the right. Notice that a container can include elements from different projects and models, but the Filters > Container in the viewer will only display elements within the selected model.
        
    6.  **Levels** – Levels are automatically brought in from the Revit model or AutoCAD drawing.
        
    7.  **Packages** 
        
        1.  Packages are defined in Stratus under Actions.
            
        2.  **Package Category Filter toggle option**  - Because parts may exist in more than one package, so long as the package is in a different Package Category, the filter is flexible in how it works. The toggle applies a rule that say ALL the checked boxes, or, ANY of the checked boxes apply.  
            
        3.  In this Packages toggle example the **Show Parts For All Selection** option is checked. Parts are visible because they exist in any checked package.
            
        4.  In this Packages toggle example the **Filter Parts Across Categories** option is checked. Parts are hidden because they don't exist in packages selected in both categories. 
            
        5.  In addition, the filter includes information about the number of parts in the currently selected view. Some parts are "**Unassigned Parts**" which means they have not yet been assigned to a package, and some parts are "**not in view**" which means the parts cannot display because they are not in the selected view. You would need to switch to the view that contains those parts in order to view them.
            
    8.  **Systems** – Systems are automatically brought in from the Revit model or AutoCAD drawing and breaks out your services by material and size.
        
    9.  **Tracking** – Company tracking statuses are configured by the Stratus Admin.
        
        1.  **Date Range option**
            
            1.  The date range option can be used to run reports for KPIs. For example, it can be used to display all items that have changed to the “Fabricated” status in the last month. All Tracking statuses are displayed in the list even if they do not have matching parts in the viewer. To use the date range under Filters > Tracking:
                
            2.  By default, the Tracking date range option is disabled and unchecked.  
                
                ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/41c53ba7-579d-443d-8b19-235952cba2e0)
                
            3.  Click the **Changes** checkbox to enable the feature.
                
                1.  All tracking statuses will be displayed in the list since dates change, different parts can be included and the counts for each will also update.
                    
                2.  By default, the date range end date is set for today and the start date is set for 30 days in the past.
                    
            4.  Set the dates as needed.  
                
                ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/5d50643d-f243-4399-92a2-d29b6380ac62)
                
            5.  Hover over either date to display the number of days, including the end date, that are in the date range.  
                
                ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/20a27f76-f827-4614-a8f3-c962715b8077)
                
            6.  Disable the Tracking date range option by unchecking the Changes checkbox.
                
    10.  **References**
        
        1.  References filters linked to models or xrefs published along with the primary model. In Revit, a specific view (based on the Publish Settings) may be selected for background viewing.  If the selected view does not include a 3D view, a message will display.
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/9b46e0e8-66ef-4263-8a23-68a27c1eb0d5)
            
        2.  The References filter includes **Clip Settings** within all of the viewers (Models, Packages, and Assemblies).
            
            1.  **Default Clip Settings** - The default **Clip Settings** for Bottom, Top, Left, Right, Front, and Back will be different for every assembly, package, and model because they are based on the bounding box for the isolated parts in each.
                
            2.  **Viewer Preferences** - Saved Clip Settings changes will only be applied automatically on page refresh when Account Settings > Profile > Viewer Preference are checked.  
                
                ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/5ec5a092-eaaf-4b22-a647-63236a785033)
                
            3.  To **Save** **Clip Settings** changes after making changes (**Example: Assemblies > Viewer**):
                
                1.  In the Assemblies > Viewer, open the **References** tool. The **Clip Settings** and **References** display.
                    
                    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/e81777e0-a3d9-405d-a794-ddfc9b75dc88)
                    
                2.  Select a Reference (Ex. **ReferencePipe.rvt**) and it will display.
                    
                    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/aa4a6d86-b0f4-4521-ab38-bfc15a816c63)
                    
                3.  Edit the **Clip Settings**. In the example below, the Right **Clip Setting** was checked and the value changed from -47.83 to -55. This change is not yet saved.
                    
                    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/d2687057-2189-4dcf-92f5-c0a9084a8741)
                    
                4.  Click the **Save the current selection for this view of the model** button. The **Save Settings** dialog will display. Notice that the confirmation dialog displays to let you know that the change is applied when any user open this assembly in the viewer. Click **Ok** to save the changes. Like other Filters, changes to References are applied to the Stratus Sheet and Attachments > Reports.
                    
                    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/5dd69db9-37ed-4040-9971-d7ba57fa0054)
                    
            4.  To **Reset Clip Settings**:
                
                1.  In the Assemblies > Viewer, open the **References** tool. The **Clip Settings** and **References** display.
                    
                    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/8ee4417c-aa92-4412-8cd6-36fb49c7d937)
                    
                2.  Click the **Reset the model clipping values to extents of visible parts** button. The **Clip Settings** values will revert to their original clip values (Ex. Right = -47.83). Any checked **Clip Settings** (Ex. Right) or checked **References** (Ex. ReferencePipe.rvt 3D) will remain checked. Click **Save** to save changes. Otherwise, refreshing the page will revert back to the previously saved values (Ex. -55).
                    
                    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/026a5ae0-7a19-41d1-9f05-5fddd3302ae5)
                    
2.  **Filters search window - apply to results button**
    
    1.  The Filters search window and apply a results button applies to all filters.  Users can **enter a search** such as “Water” under the Systems filter which filters the tree list down to only systems that include “Water” in them.  A **Check Search Results** button appears to the right of the search text box and when clicked it toggles the checkbox selection for each item displayed in the tree that matches the search criteria.
        
        Below are some examples:
        
3.  **Filters – Areas Cascade Checkbox**
    
    1.  Under Models > Viewer > Filter by Area, there are cascading checkboxes that enable you to:
        
        1.  Select all areas within the level.
            
        
        3.  Select children areas independent of the parent.
            

### Filter Loading from Account Settings > Viewer Preferences

Each user’s last set of filters per model are stored. Filters for the Models Viewer are separate from the Packages Viewer filters. Each user can configure whether they want last session filters to be automatically or manually applied.

To configure last session filters to be applied automatically under **Account Settings > Viewer Preferences:**

-   See the [**Viewer Preferences**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1953858294/Profile#View-Preferences "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1953858294/Profile#View-Preferences") article for more information on how to configure these Viewer Preferences.
    
-   See the [**Automatically Load Last Session Filter Settings**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/9043969#ModelsViewer-AutomaticallyLoadLastSessionFilterSettings "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/9043969#ModelsViewer-AutomaticallyLoadLastSessionFilterSettings") example below on how these settings are applied in the viewers.
    

To manually apply last session filters using the **Load Last** button within the Filters dialog, see the [**Manually Load Last Session Filter Settings**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/9043969#ModelsViewer-ManuallyLoadLastSessionFilterSettings "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/9043969#ModelsViewer-ManuallyLoadLastSessionFilterSettings") example below. 

#### Manually Load Last Session Filter Settings

The following example is for the Models Viewer, however, the Packages Viewer works the same.

When **Models Viewer** is unchecked under **Account Settings > Viewer Preferences,** Model filter settings will not be automatically applied when a viewer opens. Because the filter setting change for each model and the packages within the model are always stored, they can be manually applied at any time by clicking the **Load Last** button in the Filters panel.

Below is the filter behavior when **Account Settings > Viewer Preferences > Models Viewer** is unchecked under **Apply last session filter settings.** 

1.  When the Viewer > Filter is opened, the filter settings will be **Off** since no filters will have been applied.
    
2.  If filters have previously been applied, click the **Load Last** button.
    
    1.  The **last session Model filter settings** will be applied. See below for more information.
        
3.  When the user checks a filter:
    
    1.  The individual filter will be checked and actively applied to the viewer.
        
    2.  The Filter Group will be **On.**
        
    3.  The All Filter Group button will be **On**.
        
    4.  The Filters button in the toolbar will be highlighted blue.
        
    5.  This is the **last session Model filter settings** which is stored. If filters had already been checked, then this new filter will be added to the **last session Model filter settings**.
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/18cff9ab-28d0-4308-b88e-9bf2536dd077)
        
4.  If the user unchecks a filter:
    
    1.  The individual filter will be unchecked and no longer applied to the viewer.
        
    2.  The Filter Group will be **On** unless there are no remaining individual filters within the Filter Group in which case the Filter Group button will be **Off**.
        
    3.  The All Filter Group button will be **On** unless there are no remaining filters in which case the All Filter Group button will be **Off**.
        
    4.  The Filters button in the toolbar will be highlighted blue unless there are no remaining filters in which case the Filters button will not be highlighted.
        
    5.  This is the **last session Model filter settings** which is stored.  
        A browser session is restarted by one of the following
        
    6.  Refresh the page.
        
    7.  Change to a different Model.

            1.  **\- Remove Selected** \-  Click this button to remove parts that were selected using any of the Item selection methods (above) to the selected Area.
                
            2.  **\- Remove Visible** - Click this button to remove parts that are visible in the Model Viewer through the Stratus filters to the selected Area.
                

### Assemblies

1.  **Assemblies** - See the [**Create and Manage Assemblies**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/65634315 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/65634315") article for information. 
    

### Attachments

1.  **Attachments** - You can view attachments to a part, assembly, or package. An attachment can be:
    
    1.  a file attached to a part that is accessible to Stratus after the publish processes.
        
    2.  a document or image that was attached to a part, assembly, or package using Stratus.
        

### Categories

1.  **Categories** - Categories or Cost Categories are configured by your company Admin under Admin > Company > Categories. These categories can be assigned to any part selected or isolated in the model.
    

### Containers

The Models Viewer and Packages Viewer includes the **Actions > Containers** dialog to provide the ability to add/remove items (parts, assemblies, and packages) to/from a container.

#### Assign Permission

**To assign permission to use this feature:**

1.  Go to Admin > Company > Project Roles.
    
    1.  **Models Viewer** - Select Models > Viewer > Actions > Containers
        
    2.  **Packages Viewer** - Select Packages > Details > Viewer > Toolbar > Actions > Containers
        

#### Select or Filter Items in the Viewer

Items (Parts, Assemblies, Packages) can either be selected (highlighted in the viewer) or filtered (visible) in the viewer.

-   To **select** (highlight in the viewer) a part, assembly, or package, use Window Select or Select Connected tool, or via a Click, Ctrl-Click, and Shift-Click.
    
-   To **filter** (not highlighted but visible in the viewer) a part, assembly, or package in the viewer, use a Stratus filter.
    
-   The **Add Assemblies** checkbox, when checked, provides a way to select a part within an assembly and add the entire assembly to the Container.
    

**To select items in the viewer to Add/Remove To/From a Container:**

1.  **Selected** - Select any item(s). Actions buttons remain disabled until a Container is selected.
    
    1.  Once a Container is selected all 4 action buttons will be enabled (Ex. **Add Selected**, **Remove Selected**, **Add Visible**, **Remove Visible**). **Note:** Add/Remove Visible buttons can still be used, but these commands are not limited to the selected (highlighted) parts.
        
2.  **Filter Visible** \- When a filter is used and no items are selected in the viewer. The filtered items are visible.
    
    1.  Once a Container is selected only the **Add Visible** and **Remove Visible** buttons are enabled since no parts have been selected.
        
3.  **Select Items in Container**
    
    1.  When an item is selected that is already in a container, the Container Type and Container name will display.
        
    2.  If multiple parts are selected and belong to different containers, only the container of the first selected item will be displayed.
        

#### Actions > Containers Summary

Below are definitions of the Action > Containers options:

1.  **Container Type** - To filter containers, select **Container Type**.
    
2.  **Container (Required)** - A list of all company containers displays and can be filtered by the selected **Container Type**. Select a container to add/remove items.
    
    1.  **Add Assemblies (checkbox)**
        
        1.  **Checked (default)** \- When **Add Assemblies** is checked, if any part selected in the viewer is also included in an assembly, then the entire assembly will be added to the container when any of the Add/Remove buttons are clicked.
            
        2.  **Unchecked** \- When **Add Assemblies** is unchecked, individual assembly parts can be added to a container.
            
            1.  In this example, the selected part is also included in an assembly and Add Selected is clicked.
                
            2.  Even though the part belongs to an assembly, only the selected part will be added to the container when Add/Remove Selected buttons are clicked.
                
3.  **Add Selected** - After selecting items in the viewer, click the **Add Selected** button to add the selected items to the selected container. Visible items not selected will not be added.
    
4.  **Remove Selected** - After selecting items in the viewer, click the **Remove Selected** button to remove the selected items from the selected container. Visible items not selected will not be removed.
    
5.  **Add Visible** \- Any part that displays in the viewer is Visible. **Note**: If the **Hidden Parts Shaded** tool is checked, those hidden parts are not considered visible. Use filters as needed to isolate items to be added to a container. Click the **Add Visible** button to add the items to the selected container.
    
    1.  **Note**: Only the visible parts of a package will be added to the container, not the entire package if it is not visible or included in the View.
        
6.  **Remove Visible** \- Any part that displays in the viewer is Visible. **Note**: If the **Hidden Parts Shaded** tool is checked, those hidden parts are not considered visible. Use filters as needed to isolate items to be removed from a container. Click the **Remove Visible** button to remove the items from the selected container.
    
    1.  **Note**: Only the visible parts of a package will be removed, not the entire package if it is not visible or included in the View.
        

#### Example: Add Selected Items to a Container

1.  Select items to be added to a container. All Actions buttons remain disabled until a Container is selected.
    
2.  Select a **Container (Required)** - A list of all company containers displays and can be filtered by the selected **Container Type**. Once a container has been selected, the action buttons will be enabled.
    
3.  Click the **Add Selected** button. The selected items will be added to the container under Containers > Assign. A Tracking row will be automatically added and include the Comment “Stratus Added”.
    

#### Example: Add Visible Items to a Container

1.  Filter to items to be added to a container. In this example, the filtered package includes an assembly and loose parts. All Actions buttons remain disabled until a Container is selected.
    
2.  Select a **Container (Required)** - A list of all company containers displays and can be filtered by the selected **Container Type**. Once a container has been selected, the Actions buttons will be enabled. Since no items were selected, the **Add Selected** button remains disabled.
    
3.  **Click the Add Visible** button. The visible items will be added to the container under Containers > Assign. A Tracking row will be automatically added and include the Comment “Stratus Added”.
    
    1.  By expanding the Package, the 2 assemblies and loose parts display.
        

#### Example: Remove Selected

Parts, assemblies, and packages can be removed from a container individually or as a whole.

1.  Using the previous **Example: Add Visible Items to a Container**, select items to be removed from a container. In this example, all loose parts were selected.
    
2.  **Remove Selected** - After selecting items in the viewer, click the **Remove Selected** button to remove the items from the selected container. Only the assemblies remain.
    

#### Example: Remove Visible

1.  Using the previous **Example: Add Visible Items to a Container**, filter to an assembly to be removed from a container and selected the Container. **Note**: When **Hidden Parts Shaded** is checked, the hidden parts are not considered “Visible” so using the Add/Remove Visible button will not impact those items.
    
2.  Under Containers > Assign, the visible assembly has been removed.
    

#### Example: Move Items From Selected Container

1.  If a selected item is already included in a Container and the user attempts to add it to a different container, a “**Move items from selected container?”** message similar to the following will display where the user can **Cancel** or **Move** the parts from one container to the other.
    

### Packages

1.  **Packages** - See the [**Create Packages**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/67502081 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/67502081") article for information about creating a package. 
    

### Reports

1.  **Reports** - Reports, including CSV table reports, PDF formatted reports, and ZPL label reports are configured by your company admin. Once run, they will either display in a separate tab or be downloaded to your computer. A report can be run on:
    
    1.  **Run for Selected** - Limits the report data to the selected parts in the current view. This option will be disabled if no parts have been selected.
        
    2.  **Run for Visible** - Limits the report data to the visible parts in the current view. 
        
    3.  **Entire Model** - Generates report data for all parts in the model regardless of the view.
        

### Tracking

1.  **Tracking** - This is one way to apply a tracking status to a part, assembly, or package. If applying a new tracking status to isolated parts in a model, if a package or assembly has been isolated so that all its parts are visible, the tracking status change will be applied to the package’s or assembly’s log as appropriate. To change a tracking status:
    
    1.  Selecting the part, assembly, or package in the model
        
    2.  Selecting the target tracking status (Design below)
        
    3.  Selecting a Division (Detailing below)
        
    4.  Optionally adding information like a comment, hours, cost type, and/or cost
        
    5.  and then applying the information to the items that have either been **Selected** or **Isolated** (using Filters) 
        

## Grid Offset Measurement

1.  For a digital tape measure, click the **Grid Offset Measurement** tool and then select an item in the model. The tool will display the item’s dimension offset from grid line intersections. You can pick which level the tool is referencing and select which grid to measure in the drop-down. The distance to the X, Y grid line will display for point A and point B.
    

## Display Grid

1.  The **Display Grid** button shows the grids from the model or a Revit referenced model (see below). 
    
    1.  **Note**: Lines, in general, are only visible within the Stratus model viewer if you have the Forge viewer setting to "Display lines" toggled on.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/c6018db4-2665-4682-9b77-a0526ee9596d)
        
2.  The grid displays at the elevation of the selected part.
    
3.  The grid intersection annotation includes a dash separator to better represent the individual grid values.
    
4.  The grid can be used from a reference model. To use this feature:
    
    1.  In the Publish dialog, check the **Include References** checkbox.
        
    2.  In a Stratus Viewer, under **References**, check the model that includes the grid.
        
    3.  The **Grid Offset Measurement** tool will work as well.
        

## Window Select

The **Window Select** tool behaves differently depending on how you click and drag the mouse.

1.  Before each attempt to Window Select, make sure the button is enabled. 
    
2.  **Click and drag left to right** \- When the **Window Select** tool is drawn from left to right, parts are selected when the are within the bounds of the selecting box.
    
3.  **Click and drag right to left** - When the **window selection** tool is drawn from right to left, parts are selected when the selecting box touches the part.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/d24854c8-4de1-4329-8469-8f995fa5b69c)
    

## Select Connected

1.  The **Select Connected** command selects all items connected to the selected item or range of items. In addition to being a fast selection tool, using either the Select Connected or Window Select commands will ensure that small parts like welds and olets are selected. Only parts that are in the selected view or filter will be included when Selected Connected is clicked. As a result, parts that are not in the selected view or filter but are connected to a part that is in the view or filter, will not be selected. Select Connected can be used as a filter to create an assembly or package. For example:
    
    1.  **Select one part and then click Selected Connected** to select all connected parts.
        
    2.  To select a run range, click the first part, **hold down the Ctrl key** and select the last part. Everything in between will be selected.
        
    3.  You can also **select branches** by clicking a part in this branch, click the Tee, click the part on this run, and then click the **Select Connected** button.
        
    4.  Or, if you want to select multiple runs, click the first and last parts on this run, click the first and last parts on another run, and then click the **Select Connect** button.
        
    5.  In this case, all of the conduits at the end of a bank of conduit runs have been selected.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/13a9fb96-c0ca-4f62-82cc-9882ddc1bca3)
        
    6.  Click **Select Connected** has the effect of grabbing all of the downstream parts.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/ba7bce59-687f-4131-8b07-d45b980b831b)
        
    7.  In this case, the ends of two different spools have been connected.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/54a58cb9-492f-48b7-b76b-a9b7e6584762)
        
    8.  Click **Select Connected** has the effect of grabbing all of the parts between the selected parts.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/7b812c1b-f161-4157-9a15-5b4ece45e9f8)
        
    9.  Once parts are selected, you can execute any of the commands under Actions like add selected parts to an assembly or package, change tracking status, run a report and more.
        

## Properties

The **Properties** tool displays the properties of one or more selected parts from the Revit or AutoCAD database. This tool is available in all viewers.

1.  To display item properties, click the **Properties** button and an item from the viewer. Depending on each user's settings, property values captured from the model will display. 
    
2.  **Parts Selected** - The number of parts selected in the viewer displays. **Note**: Part Template links will be provided for each part selected.
    
3.  **All Properties** - Checkbox toggles the display from the Display Template, if any, to All Properties.
    
    1.  **Unchecked** - When Unchecked, only the properties whose Visible option is checked under Admin > Company > Part Templates > Template (selected) > Properties will display. See the **Visible** section of the [**Configure Part Properties**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217809750/Part+Templates+Admin#Configure-Part-Properties "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217809750/Part+Templates+Admin#Configure-Part-Properties") article for more information.
        
    2.  **Checked** - When Checked, all Properties will display in alphabetic order. If Hide Empty Values is checked, then those properties will not display.
        
    3.  **Note:** The setting will persist after the is page refreshed.
        
4.  **Hide Empty Values** - Hides properties that have blank values.
    
    1.  **Unchecked** \- Allows the display of properties that have blank values
        
    2.  **Checked** \- Prevents the display of properties that have blank values.
        
    3.  **Note:** The setting will persist after the is page refreshed.
        
5.  **Template Name** - The Template Name is the name of the part template for the selected part. The **Template Name** is linked to the Admin > Company > Part Templates page for the selected part where its properties, including its **Visible** and Item **Number settings** can be edited. When clicked, the Part Templates page will display in a separate window and the Parts Search will be filled with the template name. Select the part template to display Properties. **Permission**: The Template Name only displays for users who have been assigned a **Company Role** where **Part Templates** is checked.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/732e3c57-81f3-4146-a774-8c4f0deabb93)
    
6.  **Filter Properties** - Search for any part of the Name or Value to filter the list of properties.
    
    1.  The search value will be retained when selecting other parts or assemblies within the same viewer.
        
        1.  Enter a search value (Ex. ci). With All Properties selected, the list of properties filters to those that contain the search criteria.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/caed31ad-23c6-4a56-9b1c-316895d3d899)
            
        2.  Select a different part. The search value is retained and the list of properties is filtered.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/4ef4075c-42bf-4234-bf86-688032dcfd04)
            
    2.  To clear the search field and list All Properties, do one of the following:
        
        1.  Click the **x** button within the search text box.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/8d0dce70-3282-4b63-84c5-fb1c1d4c10d1)
            
        2.  Or, delete the text in the search text box.
            
7.  **Properties Table**
    
    1.  **Sort Columns** \- Click the up/down arrows in the column header to sort the Name or Value column. The active sort will be highlighted darker.
        
    2.  In the Properties table above, **neither All Properties or Hide Empty Values is checked**. Therefore, the Display Template, since one exists for this template, limits the table to Size, Item Descriptions, etc.
        
    3.  In the Properties table below, **All Properties** is checked. Therefore, all part properties display in alphabetic order including properties with Empty Values.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/e4f15c43-1cb3-4a1b-a6e1-59f00fcf5b24)
        
    4.  In the Properties table below, **All Properties and Hide Empty Values are checked**. Therefore, all part properties except properties with Empty Values display in alphabetic order.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/a35c6b58-97f4-4bf6-a7fa-139452516ba1)
        
    5.  In the Properties table below, since the Display Template includes no parts to show (Visible) and since All Properties has not been checked, the Properties table displays "**No data available in table**." To display properties, click check the All Properties checkbox or Edit Display Template and show selected .properties.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/fb3c46d3-30a8-4c1c-b134-555f1bdcf843)
        
    6.  **Multiple Parts Selected** - When multiple parts are selected, the Properties panel will accommodate different and common part properties.
        
        1.  In this example, 2 parts are selected. Notice that both Part Template names display separated by a semi-colon. The value <varies> indicates the value is not the same between the selected parts.
            
    7.  If one of the part properties is editable and none of the selected parts have any values, the property will display "Empty". Editing this property will set the value for all parts selected.
        
    8.  If one of the part properties is editable and any of the selected parts has a value, the property will display "<varies>". Editing this property will set the value for all parts selected.

# Non-modeled Field Requests - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> Non-modeled Field Requests for modeled projects can be handled in STRATUS using common workflows that enable you to track the package and assembly through the project.  Workflows where the project does not have a model can be accomplished however, currently, a model with at least one 3D object must be published to the project.

Non-modeled Field Requests for modeled projects can be handled in STRATUS using common workflows that enable you to track the package and assembly through the project.  Workflows where the project does not have a model can be accomplished however, currently, a model with at least one 3D object must be published to the project.

The Package's STRATUS Sheet tab displays targeted reports based on details of the selected Package. Some package details like assembly names, spool names, or item numbers can be added to the package before the report is generated. Creating a Package STRATUS Sheet requires a 2-step process: 1) Create a Template and 2) Create a Report associated with the Template.

## Create a Package Category

-   Though not required, you can create an Admin > Company > **Package Category** to categorize and name your Field Request. Ex. **Field Request** with the abbreviation set to **FR**.
    

## Create a Package

1.  Create a Package either under **Packages > Dashboard > New Package**, or the more common workflow under **Models > Viewer > Actions > Packages > New Package**.
2.  Name the Package
    1.  Override any Package naming, like BIM Area Abbreviation, that is not relevant for the Field Request.
    2.  Select the Package Category if applicable.
3.  Open the Package. Here you can you use Package Tools like Tracking and Notes.
4.  Attach the Field Request to the package. Often times a field request is sketched on a piece of paper or is a PDF from an outside source.
    1.  Select the Attachments tab and click the New Attachment button.
    2.  Select the attachment. The attachment is now part of the package.
5.  Attach the Field Request to an assembly. Often times a field request is sketched on a piece of paper or is a PDF from an outside source.
    1.  Select the Attachments tab and click the New Attachment button.
    2.  Select the attachment. The attachment is now part of the package.
6.  When the shop opens the package, they will see that there is an attachment.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/242974730/image2019-6-19_14-0-18.png?version=1&modificationDate=1560970819517&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=336&height=170)
7.  Click to open the attachment and work from the sketch.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/242974730/image2019-6-19_14-0-40.png?version=1&modificationDate=1560970841891&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=212&height=311)
8.  If bill of materials are needed, click the package’s **BOM** tab, click the **New Line Item** button and then add a row for each item adding as much detail as needed.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/242974730/image2019-6-19_14-1-1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1560970862637&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=624&height=126)
9.  Note: All cuts would be manual cuts. This workflow would not send TigerStop cut list information to the station.
10.  The packages tracking status can be updated in the Assembly Viewer or the Package’s Tracking tab, so the package’s tracking status and task workflows can be used just like a modeled package.

## Create Attachment

A Package Attachment can be created in several ways from the Attachments tab and from the Stratus Sheet tab.

## Stratus Sheet Tab

A Package attachment (PDF) is automatically generated from the package's Stratus Sheet tab by clicking the PDF button. See the [**PDF**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/199884912/Package+STRATUS+Sheet#PDF "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/199884912/Package+STRATUS+Sheet#PDF") article for more information.

## Attachments Tab

There are several ways to create an attachment within the Attachments tab.

### Add Attachment

Click the **Add Attachment** button to locate and upload a file attachment.

### Capture Image

Click the **Capture Image** button to locate and upload a image file attachment.

### Create Report

Select a report and click the **Create** button to create the report as an attachment.

### Package Assemblies Batch Report PDF

A Batch Report (PDF) can be run for a Package's Assemblies. To do this:

1.  Create a template and report for the Package Assemblies Batch Report. See the [Package Assemblies Batch Report PDF](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393/Reports+Admin#Example:PackageAssembliesBatchReportPDF "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393/Reports+Admin#Example:PackageAssembliesBatchReportPDF") section on the [Reports (Admin)](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393") article for more information.
    
2.  Once the template and report are ready, open a package.
    
3.  Click the **Attachments** tab.
    
4.  Select the batch report created for this report. Notice that when a Batch Report report is selected, the Create button changes to the **Create for Assemblies** button.
    
5.  Click the **Create for Assemblies** button. A separate PDF is being created for each assembly, so this may take a few minutes depending on the number of assemblies. Notice the percent complete indicator and that each PDF will display in the list as it is created.
    

## Attachments Table

## Attachment Preview

To preview an attachment (Only: .txt, .pdf, .csv, and a .jpg) in the Attachments tab.

1.  **Hover** over the attachment and the **Click to toggle preview** message will display. Notice too that the row highlights.
    
2.  Click in the row anywhere in the area highlighted in red (above) to preview the file in the Attachments tab. **Note**: Clicking on the file link will also open the file in a separate tab where it can be downloaded.
    

PDF Attachments include Markup information and the Markup editor button.

1.  All .PDF attachments will include the **Markups** pencil icon to the left of the Delete button. Click this button to open the **Markups Tools**. See the [**Markup Tools**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2308407297/Markup+for+PDF+Assembly+and+Package+Attachments+and+CAD+Sheet#Markup-Tools "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2308407297/Markup+for+PDF+Assembly+and+Package+Attachments+and+CAD+Sheet#Markup-Tools") article for more information.
    
2.  Any .PDF that has an **active unversioned** Markup will display a number to the left of the Markups pencil icon (Ex. 2). **Note**: Markups do not have to be versioned to be useful as anyone with access can view/edit active unversioned Markups. See below.
    
3.  Any .PDF where the **Upload Version** button has been clicked and saved to BIM360 will display a V# (Ex. V2).
    

## Stratus Sheet Orientation Matches Attachment Report

On both the Assemblies > Stratus Sheet tab and the Package’s Stratus Sheet tab, the orientation of the isometric view can be edited and saved. For example:

1.  On this Package’s Stratus Sheet and selected report, the default isometric view displays.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/a6639052-afdb-4ef1-bd11-b4d310f1f026)
    
2.  The isometric view orientation can be edited and saved using the “Adjust the orientation and zoom for this package in the viewer” button. Below the orientation was changed to a Front view and saved.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/4c3e5802-3f03-4842-a4f8-41635fd398b4)
    
3.  The saved Stratus Sheet orientation will display on Reports like a Master Report on the Package’s Attachments tab.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/ff0c2a27-4f67-42d3-a12e-4e96ccc31ee7)
    
4.  In this Master Report, the sub-report “Sub-Report P 8” is the same report that was used to edit the Stratus Sheet above.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/96c43512-4cdd-4169-ab56-8b5e61eee6b1)
    
5.  With the report opened, the saved isometric view orientation (Front view) edited in the Package’s Stratus sheet will display.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/f3516b5c-b6c6-417e-9224-5faaa2fe20a5)
    

## Videos

See the Packages Module Overview webinar [**CSG Webinar: Stratus In-Depth Series, The Packages Module**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/3309693/Packages#01/28/2021CSGWebinar:STRATUSIn-DepthSeries,ThePackagesModule(1:01:57) "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/3309693/Packages#01/28/2021CSGWebinar:STRATUSIn-DepthSeries,ThePackagesModule(1:01:57)") for more information.

## Generate a BOM Report

1.  Before generating a BOM, check the package category for the selected package. Some companies use a specific package category for Purchasing.
    
2.  The BOM report will display by default. See below for how to create a new BOM Report to be selected during the Generate a BOM Report process.
    
3.  In order to enable the **BOM** button, the package must be in a tracking status where **Can BOM is checked.**  Click the Tracking tab to change the tracking status. See the [**Tracking Statuses**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761") article for more information.
    
4.  With a valid tracking status set for the package, the package's **BOM** button is enabled.
    
5.  After clicking the **BOM** button, a consolidated list of items that can be sorted, filtered, added, and made to be reportable, similar to the following displays. 
    
6.  The BOM list includes the following options.  
    
    1.  **BOM Settings** - See the [**BOM Settings**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#BOMSettings "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#BOMSettings") section below.
        
    2.  **Add (Line) Item** - See the [**Add a New Line Item**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#AddaNewLineItem "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#AddaNewLineItem") section below.
        
    3.  **Required Date** - The Required Date entered here is a generic BOM date. There are several independent dates related to a BOM.
        
        1.  **Required Date (set on the Package's BOM tab)** - Currently, the **Required Date** set on the Package's BOM tab is whatever your company wants it to mean.
            
        2.  **Purchasing Start Date** - Under Package > Properties > Planning, the Purchasing Start Date represents the date that the Purchasing manager should be scheduled to start purchasing activities for the package. See the [**Lead Days Package Level Configuration**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/260603982/Package+Properties#LeadDaysPackageLevelConfiguration "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/260603982/Package+Properties#LeadDaysPackageLevelConfiguration") article for more information.
            
    4.  **Division** - A Package BOM can be assigned to a Division. See the [**Division (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103317524 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103317524") article for more information.
        
    5.  **Show Reportable** - The Show Reportable checkbox controls line items that are visible in the table based on the item's Reportable status. See the [**Show Reportable**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#ShowReportable "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#ShowReportable") section for more information.
        
        1.  **Checked** - When checked, only line items whose Reportable checkbox have been checked will display in the table.
            
        2.  **Unchecked (default)** - When unchecked, all line items will display in the table.
            
    6.  **Save Manual Overrides** - The **Show Manual Overrides** button only applies to the following data fields: QTY, Unit of Measure, Size, Description, Manufacturer, Material, Product Code, and Additional Info. After a manual override has been made (Ex. Additional Info changed to Manual Override), the BOM data refreshes and the question mark icon displays within the overridden cell and hover text informs the user the **Original value: Empty**.   
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/f9abc9d5-3888-4f8b-9540-199271885bd5)
        
        1.  **Unchecked Save Manual Overrides** - When the **Save Manual Overrides** checkbox is unchecked and the **Generate BOM** button is clicked, the text “Manual Override” within the Additional Info cell will return to it’s original value which was Empty.
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/2b56ffb7-0085-470a-ae9d-7654808bfd11)
            
        2.  **Checked** **Save Manual Overrides** \- When the **Save Manual Overrides** checkbox is checked and the **Generate BOM** button is clicked, the text “Manual Override” within the Additional Info cell will be retained.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/b2c17717-78a4-4274-aff3-9796b99cb77a)
            
    7.  **Report** - Displays a list of reports where Item Type = **BOM**. Click the download button to download the report for the displayed BOM.
        
    8.  **Reportable** - The Reportable checkbox indicates whether or not a line item will display in any BOM report or, depending on the Show Reportable checkbox, whether or not the line item will display in the table. See the [**Reportable**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#Reportable "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#Reportable") section for more information.
        
        1.  **Checked (default)** - When checked, the line item will display in a BOM Report.
            
        2.  **Unchecked** - When unchecked, the line item will not display in a BOM Report.
            
    9.  **CSV | Excel** - Click the CSV or Excel button to download the displayed BOM table “as is” to a file.
        
    10.  **BOM Mappings** - See the [**Company BOM Line Item Mappings**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#CompanyBOMLineItemMappings "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166690857/Package+BOM#CompanyBOMLineItemMappings") section below.
        
    11.  **Search** the BOM list by Size, Description, Material, Diameter, Width, and Length.
        
    12.  **Sort** rows by a specific column by clicking the 
        
         button.
        
    13.  **Unit of Measure** – The Unit of Measure shows how the selected part is measured. By default, all new items are set to the “Each” unit of measure.
        
    14.  **Size, Description, Manufacturer, Material, Diameter, Width, Length** – These fields are extracted from the part’s AutoCAD/Revit database. The field used for display can be overridden on the BOM Line Item Override dialog by clicking the Settings associated with the part.
        
    15.  **Product Code** – Product codes are determined by:
        
        1.  Looking in Part.Properties based on the Code (Part.Code).
            
        2.  If none are found, STRATUS looks in the Part.CinxProperties
            
    16.  **Comment** – An editable field to enter a comment as needed.
        

## Working with a BOM 

## Add a New Line Item

-   **New Line Item** – To add non-modeled line items, like a box of washers, to the BOM list, click the **New Line Item** button, enter the required information or more, and click save.
    

## Reportable

The Reportable checkbox indicates whether or not a line item will display in any BOM report or, depending on the Show Reportable checkbox, whether or not the line item will display in the table. 

1.  **Checked (default)** - When checked, the line item will display in a BOM Report.
    
2.  **Unchecked** - When unchecked, the line item will not display in a downloaded BOM Report.
    

## Show Reportable

The **Show Reportable** checkbox indicates whether or not a line item will display in a Package BOM report. In addition, when the Show Reportable checkbox is checked, the table will only display Reportable line items.

1.  **Checked (default)** - When checked, the line item will display in a BOM Report. 
    
    1.  In the example below, the Reportable checkbox for line items where the Description equals Nut are unchecked. Since **Show Reportable** is unchecked, the line items still display in the table.
        
2.  **Unchecked** - When unchecked, the line item will not display in a BOM Report.
    
    1.  In the example below, the Reportable checkbox for line items where the Description equals Nut are unchecked. Since **Show Reportable** is checked, the line items do not display in the table.
        

## Inline Field Editing

Inline field editing provides a way to override **default mapped values** and **Company BOM Line Item Mappings** values. For example

1.  Below is the original BOM. In this example, all values are default mapped values although they could be **Company BOM Line Item Mappings** values as well. Values with blue font are editable.
    
2.  Click into a cell (Ex. Size where size = Shop Weld \[6\]), edit the content (Ex. Edited), and click the check to save.
    
3.  The edited value will display along with a tooltip (Ex. Original value: Shop Weld \[6\]). Notice that the cell background color turns gray to indicate it has been edited. Hover over the tooltip to display the Original value.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/3c29b6a9-08e3-4d66-9415-43c0d4e538a6)
    
4.  To restore the original value, click into a cell (Ex. Edited) and either:  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/9baa3dab-f2ad-4f52-a5ab-529dfcd2b851)
    
5.  (Recommended) Click the x within the edit box, the original value will be entered automatically, and then click Save.
    
6.  Alternatively, enter the original value and then click Save.
    
7.  The original value will display and the cell background color is restored to indicate it is the original value.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/0b6c6188-b2f1-4621-b0ef-1fab89855a4b)
    
8.  If a line item **BOM Mapping** is edited the BOM table will refresh and only the edited BOM Mapping values will display, while previously edited values will return to default values or the BOM Mapped value.
    
    1.  In this example, 2 line item values have been edited (Ex. Size and Material).
        
    2.  Click the **BOM Mapping** gear icon. The **Company BOM Line Item Mappings** will display. Edit one or more BOM Mapping for the selected Part Template (Ex. Size Properties = Name).
        
    3.  When the BOM tab displays the BOM will automatically regenerate.
        
        1.  **Size** - The Size value now uses the **Company BOM Line Item Mappings** previously configured.
            
        2.  **Material** \- The Material value (previously edited) is restored to its default mapping.
            
9.  By default, permission to inline edit field in the BOM tab is unchecked and is controlled under Admin > Company > Project Roles > Packages > Details > Bill of Materials > Modify Inline Fields.
    
    1.  **Unchecked** - When a user's Project Role is unchecked, only QTY and Comment will be available to edit.
        

## Change/Reset QTY

**To change and reset the QTY for BOM line item:**

1.  Click the QTY cell. The Quantity dialog will display.
    
2.  Enter a new value. The value will be highlighted in the table.
    
3.  To reset the QTY to the original value, click the QTY cell. The Quantity dialog will display. **Note**: The Reset button does not display for non-modeled line items created using the Item button.
    
4.  Click the **Reset** button. The QTY will return to the original value.
    

## BOM Settings

BOM Settings set here at the Package level are the same as those set at the Package Category Level. See the Package Category [**BOM Settings**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351/Package+Categories+Admin#BOMSettings "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351/Package+Categories+Admin#BOMSettings") article for more information.

Click the **BOM Settings** gear icon 

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/83309ef0-9bb2-4879-be09-e352136d3f57)

to access BOM Settings.  

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/65d996f6-120f-45f5-94dc-a0e34aa47387)

### Hide Columns

To hide a column in the BOM table:

1.  Check the column in the Columns section (Ex. Product Code).
    
2.  Click **Save**. After the BOM table regenerates, the Ancillary Type column will not display.
    

### BOM Generation Options

### **Ignore Zero Quantity Line Items**

The **Ignore Zero Quantity Line Items** option can remove BOM Line Items that have 0 QTY from the BOM. When a BOM is generated if “Size”, “Description”, and “Material” are blank, a row for that item will not be generated.

**Best Practice:** For optional BOM Line Items that depend on certain part properties, it is best practice to create a custom field which returns a value of 0 when the BOM Line Item is not present and 1 (or other number) when it is, then map that field to the QTY under Admin > Company > Part Templates > BOM Line Item Mappings.

To change the **Ignore Zero Quantity Line Item** option:

1.  Access the **BOM Settings** dialog either via:
    
    1.  Admin > Company > Package Categories > BOM Settings for the package category.
        
    2.  Open the BOM and click the BOM Settings button.
        
2.  A BOM Settings dialog similar to the following will display. **Note:** The Package Category will display in the title.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/ffceeb12-8485-47c7-9e54-d76a7f46dbc0)
    
3.  **Ignore Zero Quantity Line Items**
    
    1.  **Unchecked (Default)** - Line Items whose QTY is 0 will display in the BOM.
        
    2.  **Checked** \- Line Items whose QTY is 0 will not display in the BOM.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/cc9eab8c-66ad-4ae4-b64f-372a62dbb786)
        

### **Auto Consolidate**

When checked, like items (determined by matching Description, then Material, Size, Is Modeled, Is Reportable, and then Length) will be consolidated into a row and the QTY adjusted. When unchecked, all BOM items will be included on a unique row and QTY will be 1. Alternatively, using **Unconsolidated Units Of Measure** option, you can determine which units of measure should not be consolidated. When added to the **Unconsolidated Units Of Measure** option list, the unit of measure will be ignored and not consolidated. For example, if a unit of measure is Boxes, and when consolidated a boxes BOM line item had QTY = 14, after adding Boxes to the **Unconsolidated Units Of Measure** list, each box would be on a separate row.

**Example 1**

1.  **Example - Nothing Configured for Unconsolidated Units of Measure**. **Note**: 
    
    1.  Results – Sticks are Consolidated onto one row.
        
    2.  Override the **Nominal Stock Length (in)** if it has not been set.
        
    3.  New results for Consolidated sticks where a Nominal Stock Length of 120” has been set.
        

**Example 2**

1.  **Example - Stick Configured for Unconsolidated Units of Measure.  Note:** The
    
     has to be clicked in order to set an Unconsolidated Units of Measure.
    
    1.  Results – Each stick is on an individual row
        

### **Auto Linear Nest**

The **Auto Linear Nest** option is related to the Length and QTY of straight elements.

1.  **Checked** - When checked, **Auto Linear Nest** will automatically nest linear straight elements based on the set stock length (if any). In the BOM table:
    
    1.  **Length** = the length of the material.
        
    2.  **QTY** = the number of sticks needed given that they are nested within the length.
        
    3.  **Notes** - Click the **Notes** button to display the number of cut pieces and their individual nested lengths. This uses the same algorithm that is used to nest pieces in the STRATUS Workstation.
        
2.  **Unchecked** - When unchecked, instead of linear nesting QTY will display the number of cut straight pieces and Length is the total footage.
    
    1.  **Length** = the total footage of all cut pieces.
        
    2.  **QTY** = the number of cut pieces.
        
3.  If Auto-Consolidated is checked, the length will reflect total consolidated length. When checked, the QTY will increase as the length of material needed exceeds the Stock Length.  See the **Row Quantity for straights** section and the **Example - Length Nesting** section on this page for more information about automatically nested linear straight elements based on your set stock length.
    

### **Ignore Ancillaries**

When checked (default) a part's ancillaries will not display in the BOM. When unchecked, the part’s individual ancillaries will display and will display in the BOM.

Ancillaries includes AirturnTrack, AirturnVane, AncillaryMaterial, Clip, Corner, Fixing, Gasket, Isolator, Sealant, SeamMaterial, SupportRod, TieRod, SupportSeismic, and Unknown.

For example:

1.  Below is a Fabrication ITM Hanger with Ancillary Properties:
    
2.  On the Package’s BOM tab, click the **Generate New BOM** button and the following line item would display for this package that has 1 trapeze hanger:
    
3.  To reveal the part’s ancillaries, click the **Settings** button (gear in the upper right next to the Create button). The BOM Settings dialog displays. Uncheck the **Ignore Ancillaries** checkbox.
    
4.  The Fabrication ancillary data being represented in the Package BOM along with the original line item that represents the hanger as a whole will display.
    
5.  **Special Considerations:**
    
    1.  To affect the stick quantities of length bearing items (rod, strut, etc.), you will need to populate the editable Nominal Stock Length (inches) column for the desired line items.
        
    2.  These items will still be auto consolidated as they have historically been, by their PartTemplateId, Size, Description, and Material.
        
    3.  The Package BOM properties are populated with data from CADmep under the following mapping:
        
        1.  **BOM Description** = Ancillary.ProductDescription, if empty, Ancillary.Name
            
        2.  **BOM.Diameter** = Ancillary.ProductSize, if empty, Ancillary.WidthOrDiameter
            
        3.  **BOM.Length** = STRATUS.Ancillary.Length
            
            1.  Qualified when STRATUS.Ancillary.Length > 0
                
        4.  **BOM Manufacturer** = Ancillary.ProductManufacturer
            
        5.  **BOM.Material** = Ancillary.ProductMaterial, if empty, Item.Material
            
        6.  **BOM.ProductCode** = Ancillary.ProductCode, if empty, Item.DababaseId
            
        7.  **BOM Size** = Ancillary.ProductSize, if empty, Ancillary.WidthOrDiameter
            
        8.  **BOM Type** = Ancillary.Type
            
        9.  **BOM.Usage** = Ancillary.Usage
            
        10.  **BOM.Width** = Ancillary.ProductSize, if empty, Ancillary.WidthOrDiameter\]
            
    4.  Data Format/Length/Size - This is published as Decimal Feet for Revit and Inch/mm for CADmep.
        

### BOM Group By Settings

To group BOM Line Item table data by one or more columns:

1.  Click the **Add Grouping** button.  The Group By drop-down will display. Select a column to group by (Ex. Diameter).
    
2.  To add another grouping, Click the **Add Grouping** button again and select another column. Continue as needed.
    
3.  The BOM Table will display the results. In this example, the table is first grouped by Diameter and then by Length:
    

## Company BOM Line Item Mappings

A **Company BOM Line Item Mapping** enables you to control the BOM data by changing the display property used by STRATUS. For some fields, you can also control the Format and Precision (for decimal, it means the number of decimal places; for fractions, it means the denominator to use) to display. Editing a mapping for a BOM line item will apply the change to all company projects. The exception is when the **Nominal Stock Length** is changed within the grid where the change only applies to the active BOM (See below). **Note**: STRATUS recognizes each part. If it’s a Fabrication part, settings will be based on the pattern id for the part. If it’s a Revit part family, settings will be based on the family and type.

### Configuration

A **Company BOM Line Item Mapping** can be configured globally in two places:

1.  Under Admin > Company > Part Templates > Select a part > BOM Mappings. The Company BOM Line Items Mappings sections will display.
    
2.  Or, with the Package's BOM, click the **Properties Overrides** button 
    
    associated with the line item to display the **BOM Line Item Overrides** dialog. 
    

### Configuration Properties - General

**Defaults**

1.  **Part Template Name** - Use this to locate the Part Template under Admin > Company > Part Templates.
    
2.  **Exclude from BOM** – The parts that use the Part Template can be excluded, like shop welds, from the BOM list and created reports.
    
3.  **QTY** - QTY = -1 (This doesn't mean items will be removed from the order!) See QTY override below.
    
4.  **Default** - Default displays when a property has not been changed.
    
5.  **Empty Value** - Empty Value displays when it is selected from the list of properties in the Property Override dialog.
    

### Configure Properties - Size, Diameter, Width, or Length

**To control the Size, Diameter, Width, or Length Properties:**

1.  Click the field to display the "Properties Fields" dialog. 
    
    1.  **Property** - Select the Property that contains the length value for the part template.
        
    2.  **Format** – Select the Format that should display in the Length column for the part template.
        
    3.  **Precision** – Select the precision the value should display.
        
2.  Click **Close**. 
    
3.  **Note**: To Reset a Property value, or any field except QTY, QTY Multiplier, and Unit Of Measure, clicking the **X** in the drop-down select box to “No Override”. 
    
4.  After the **Company BOM Line Item Mappings** dialog is closed, the BOM will refresh and the property value (Ex. Length) displayed as configured.
    
5.  Once saved and a new BOM generated, a visual indicator (light blue background in field cell) that a BOM line item property has been overridden. 
    
6.  Click the **Click to see notes** button to view information about the QTY with respect to the Stock Length and the resulting Nested Lengths. 
    

### Configure Properties - Description, Material, Manufacturer, Product Code

To override the properties used to display the Description, Material, Manufacturer, or Product Code:

1.  **Caution**: The Description and Material fields are used to determine whether or not a line item is unique when Auto-Consolidated. In this example, since the Description is different in each row, the line items remain unique.
    
2.  If a Manual Override (My Value) is applied to the Description field, then these line items are no longer unique.
    
      
    **To manually override one of these fields:**
    
3.  With the Package in a Can BOM Tracking Status, click the **Property Overrides** button associated with the item.
    
4.  The BOM Line Item Overrides page will display. Click one of the properties that can be manually overridden (Ex. Description). The Descriptions Fields dialog will display.
    
    1.  **Property Override** – When selected, click the drop-down and select a property from the list of all properties.
        
    2.  **Manual Override** - When selected, enter a value.
        
5.  Once saved, click **Close**.
    
6.  The BOM tab will refresh and your Property Override or Manual Override will display.
    
7.  The Property Override or Manual Override will also display when the Report is run:
    
8.  To return to the original Description, click the **Property Overrides** button associated with the item and delete the Manual Override or set the Property Override to None.
    

### QTY Override

QTY Display Rules:

-   Priority 1 (highest priority): inline editing trumps all QTY's displayed. (Auto Consolidate ONLY)
    
-   Priority 2: Part Template QTY/Multiplier overrides take next priority. (Auto Consolidate ONLY)
    
-   Priority 3 (lowest priority): QTY of line items is displayed.
    

1.  **QTY Override** - The QTY property (Quantity) can now be overridden following these rules:
    
    1.  **Row Quantity for non-straight parts** - is a count of parts with the same size, description, material, and Part Template Id.
        
    2.  **Row Quantity for straights** - is also a count of parts with the size, description, and material, but also calculates the quantity based on stock length. To determine the stock length:
        
        1.  STRATUS first looks at the Nominal Stock Length set on the **BOM Line Item Override** (click the Settings gear associated with the part). This is a good option for one-off overrides.
            
        2.  If the Line Item Override is blank, then STRATUS looks to determine your shops stock length is under **Admin** > **Company** > **Materials**. This is the recommended location to set you company’s stock length (Nominal Length) for each material. In the example below, the nominal length for Carbon Steel Pipe ¼” – 4” trade size is 10’. 
            
        3.  The total length of pipe is then divided by the stock length to determine the Quantity of pipe to purchase. This feature provides you with a linear nesting of straight parts.
            

1.  When the BOM is generated, the QTY property override value will be used.
    
2.  Manually added non-modeled line items via the New Line Item button, will always allow QTY to be edited within the BOM table.
    
3.  If ‘Auto Consolidate’ is selected, QTY should be inline-editable for modeled line items.
    
4.  If ‘Auto Consolidate’ is NOT selected (itemized BOM), QTY should NOT be inline-editable for modeled line items.
    

### QTY Multiplier

The **QTY Multiplier** override multiplies the QTY by the QTY Multiplier which results in a total QTY used on in the BOM table. In this example using the BOM below, the user can identify the line item associated with all-thread, add a New Line Item for ½” Washers and then use the QTY Multiplier to determine the number nuts for each all-thread line item QTY. To do this:

1.  For the Clevis Hanger line item, click the Property Overrides button.
    
2.  Click the New BOM Line Item Overrides button and in the first row enter as a Manual Override “all-thread” in the Description field and Save.
    
3.  Click the New BOM Line Item Overrides button and in the second row:
    
    1.  Enter as a Manual Override “1/2” Washers” in the Description field
        
    2.  Change QTY = 1
        
    3.  Change QTY Multiplier = 2
        
    
4.  Results – The QTY of ½” Washers is automatically added to the BOM and calculated based on the number of Clevis Hangers.
    

### Add Additional Property Column 

The **Additional Property** column can include any BOM field in the BOM report. To add an Additional Property column:

1.  For the BOM item, click the **Property Overrides** button.
    
2.  On the BOM Line Item Overrides dialog, click the link in the **Additional Info** column and select the property to add to the BOM (Ex. STRATUS.Alias.Alias\_Name).
    
3.  The BOM will now display the selected property in the Additional Info column.
    
4.  To display the Additional Property in the BOM report, add to the report’s Report Fields the Property Name = AdditionalProperty. Change the Header value if you would like to display a different name in the report header.
    
5.  On the BOM page, click the **Create** button associated with the BOM report (above). The report now displays the Additional Property.
    

### In-grid Override Nominal Stock Length (inches) for active BOM

The Nominal Stock Length (inches) feature provides an in-grid override option for the active BOM.  When applying a change, there is a hierarchical precedence:

1.  Priority #1: Inline nominal stock length override (when set, this is the only value that will explicitly display in the BOM ‘Nominal Stock Length’ column). All other nominal stock length overrides show up in the length tooltip.
    
2.  Priority #2: Part Template BOM mapping override.
    
3.  Priority #3: Material definition overrides (linear types only: AllThreadRod, Conduit, Pipe & Unistrut).
    

For example:

1.  To display the column, click the BOM Settings gear icon 
    
    next to the Report name to access BOM Settings and uncheck the Override Nominal Stock Length (inches) option.
    
2.  The active BOM refreshes and displays the Nominal Stock Length (inches) column.
    
3.  This package contains two 10’ length pipes.
    
4.  The Standard BOM Line Item Override on a part template set to 240”.
    
5.  Stick QTY shows (1) since two 10’ pipes fit into 20’ of stock.
    
6.  To override the Nominal Stock Length when the Unit of Measure is Stick, click the value and enter a new Nominal Stock Length (inches). In this case, enter 120 and click save.
    
7.  Click the **Generate New BOM**
    
8.  As a result, the QTY Stick quantity shows (2) since each 10’ pipe fits into 10’ of stock.
    
9.  The Nominal Stock Length value will continue to be overridden for the active BOM.
    

### Example - Length Nesting

Here’s an example of how changing the length field impacts the quantity. This example will start with default values and no Material defined for pipe.

1.  By default for the selected pipe below, the QTY = 1, however, you’ll notice hovering over the row (2<sup data-renderer-mark="true">nd</sup> screen shot) that STRATUS informs you that the nominal stock length is invalid. This is because a nominal value could not be found under Admin > Company > Materials or under the BOM Line Item Override.
    
2.  To provide STRATUS with a valid nominal stock length, I’ll add a Pipe Material where the nominal length is 10’ under **Admin** > **Company** > **Materials**.
    
3.  Now, when the package BOM list is refreshed, the Length is 120 and the QTY is 2. And, when you hover over the row (2<sup data-renderer-mark="true">nd</sup> screen shot), STRATUS will tell you that the length source is from the Company Admin > Material Definitions.
    
4.  Notice too that the “Nested Lengths” display in the hover dialog. For example, if there are 5 pipe items with the same material and size, they will be "nested" to calculate the total number of stock length pipes to order. If lengths = \[100, 100, 90, 50, 40\] and stock length = 200, the parts would be nested as \[100, 90\] and \[100, 50, 40\]. In addition, tolerance for saw blade thickness is built in
    

## Create New BOM Report

Similar to reports that can be viewed in the assembly viewer, a BOM report can be configured to display on the Packages > BOM tab. As a result, BOM reports can be printed. To configure a BOM report:

1.  Go to the **Admin** > **Company** > **Reports** page.
    
2.  Either click the **New Report** button or copy and existing report by clicking the **Clone Report**
    
3.  To configure the report, the following fields are required:
    
    1.  **Format** - For the report format, you can select either CSV (tabular data) or PDF (formatted print).
        
    2.  **Item Type** – BOM
        
    3.  **Template** – If you selected the PDF format, you’ll need to select a Template.
        
4.  Once saved, expand the report to define the report fields. The report fields are limited to those that display on the BOM list page. See the [Reports](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393") article for more information.
    
5.  With a generated BOM open, select the report from the Report drop-down and click **Create**.
    
6.  If the report format is CSV, a report similar to this will display:
    

## Print a BOM

1.  To print the report, configure a report under Admin > Company > Reports where the **Item Type is BOM** so that it will display in the Report drop-down. See the [Reports](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2621571/STRATUS%20Company%20Admin%20Reports?version=1&modificationDate=1517510757728&cacheVersion=1&api=v2 "/wiki/download/attachments/2621571/STRATUS%20Company%20Admin%20Reports?version=1&modificationDate=1517510757728&cacheVersion=1&api=v2") article for more information.
    
2.  Use a Template if you want to print a formatted report and company header. Only visible items will be printed. See the [**Templates (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1496580419 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1496580419") article for more information.

## CAD Sheet Tab

For a CAD Sheet to display under Packages > Viewer > CAD Sheet, the package name should be contained within the sheet name, allowing for extensions like ' - Sheet'.  The 2D sheets must be included in the active publish set specified in Revit.

## Create CAD Sheet

The CAD Sheet tab displays sheets created in the authoring tool. Once in STRATUS, tools can be used to Markup the sheet.

## AutoCAD

**To display an AutoCAD spool drawing:**

1.  Under Admin > Company > Settings > check the **Publish Spool Drawings** checkbox and Save.
    
2.  In AutoCAD, after a drawing is published, the associated spool drawings from AutoCAD will display in the sheet tab. 
    

## Revit

There are 2 ways for a CAD Sheet to display in a Package. In either case, CAD Sheets in STRATUS are created from Sheets selected in the Revit Publish Settings.

![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2136506369/image2024-3-19_9-48-54.png?version=1&modificationDate=1710859735389&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

### Method 1 - Create Package in STRATUS and Rename Sheet in Revit

1.  In STRATUS, create a Package (Ex. Duct Sections and with the Incrementor XXX the name will be Duct Sections001).
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2136506369/image2024-3-19_9-49-43.png?version=1&modificationDate=1710859784570&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    
2.  In Revit, create or rename a Sheet with the same name (Ex. Duct Sections001).
    
3.  In Revit, re-publish the model with the Sheet(s) selected in Revit Publish Settings.
    
4.  In STRATUS, go to the Packages > Viewer. If the **CAD Sheet tab** did not previously exist for the package, it does now.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2136506369/image2024-3-19_9-50-20.png?version=1&modificationDate=1710859822133&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    
5.  **CAD Sheet Markup** tools display. Markup is also available in the Assemblies Viewer.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2136506369/image2024-3-19_9-50-54.png?version=1&modificationDate=1710859855956&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    

### Method 2 - Create Revit Sheet and Create Package with the Same Name

1.  In Revit, publish or re-publish the model with the Sheet(s) selected in Revit Publish Settings (Ex. North Level 1 - Lighting Plan).
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2136506369/image2024-3-19_9-51-15.png?version=1&modificationDate=1710859876306&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    
2.  In STRATUS Models > Viewer, create a new package whose name matches one of the sheets in Revit Publish Settings (Ex. North Level 1 - Lighting Plan).
    
    1.  Alternatively, on the Packages > Dashboard, the **Import CSV** option can be used to import packages whose names match one or more Revit Sheet names.
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2136506369/image2024-3-19_9-51-38.png?version=1&modificationDate=1710859900067&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
        
3.  In STRATUS, go to the Packages > Viewer. The **CAD Sheet tab** will display with the Revit Sheet displayed.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2136506369/image2024-3-19_9-52-0.png?version=1&modificationDate=1710859921343&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    
4.  **CAD Sheet Markup** tools display. Markup is also available in the Assemblies Viewer.

## CAD Sheet Markup

The CAD Sheet tab displays sheets created in the authoring tool. Once in STRATUS, tools can be used to Markup the sheet. Since the CAD Sheet tab is available on the Assemblies > Viewer and the Packages > Viewer, the information is consolidated in the **[Markup for PDF Assembly Attachments, PDF Package Attachments, and CAD Sheet](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2308407297/Markup+for+PDF+Assembly+Attachments+PDF+Package+Attachments+and+CAD+Sheet)** article.

## Generate Cut Lists

On the Package's Cut List tab, use the **Generate Cut Lists** button to send a nested cut list to the STRATUS Workstation application that controls the TigerStop tool.

1.  Before you can generate a cut list targeted to the TigerStop, you must first configure a **[Tool](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220225/Tools+Admin)**, **[Division](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103317524/Processor+Admin)**, and **[Station](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220408/Station+Admin)** for the TigerStop. 
2.  In order to enable the **Generate Cut List** button on the package's Cut Lists tab, the package must be in a tracking status where **Can Cut List** option is checked. Click the Tracking tab to change the tracking status. See the **[Tracking Statuses](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761)** article for more information. ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/166723746/image2021-9-3_14-15-50.png?version=1&modificationDate=1630696552116&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1000&height=175)
3.  With a valid tracking status set for the package, the package's **Generate Cut List** button on the **Cut List** **tab** is enabled.
4.  Click the **Generate Cut List** button. Before the cut list displays STRATUS makes several checks.
    1.  **Check 1** - The cut list is checked to determine if all parts in the package are in a “Can Cut List” tracking status.
        1.  **Yes** - If all parts are in a “Can Cut List” tracking status, go to Check 2.
            
        2.  **No** \- If not, a dialog similar to the following will display indicating how many parts are not in a “Can Cut List” tracking status.
            
            ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/166723746/image2022-5-25_14-48-47.png?version=1&modificationDate=1653508128231&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
            
            1.  **Cancel** \- Click **Cancel** to stop the process and change the tracking status of parts that are not in a “Can Cut List” tracking status.
                
            2.  **Generate** \- Click **Generate** to continue with Check 2.
                
    2.  **Check 2** - The cut list is checked to determine if any of the parts have already been cut.
        
        **There are several ways to determine if a part has been cut:**
        
        1.  The cut part’s tracking status is updated to **Cut**. In the STRATUS Workstation, the **Apply Tracking Status on Done** can automatically apply a tracking status. If this tracking status is **Cut**, then the part will be considered cut. **Note:** Be sure to verify that your **Apply Tracking Status on Done** tracking status is Cut and does not have the **Can Cut List** checkbox checked.  
            ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/166723746/image2022-5-25_14-49-40.png?version=1&modificationDate=1653508181292&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=651&height=250)
            
        2.  If any part is not in a **Can Cut List** tracking status, it will be considered cut.
            
        3.  If STRATUS.Part.CutDT property is populated, the part will be considered cut.
            
        4.  If STRATUS.Part.IsCut property is 1, the part will be considered cut.
            
        5.  If the Tracking comment for a part includes the word cut, the part will be considered cut. 
            
            **Did STRATUS detect that a part has already been cut?**
            
        6.  **No** \- If no parts have been cut, the cut list will be generated.
            
        7.  **Yes** \- If a part has already been cut, a message similar to the following will display.  
            ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/166723746/image2022-5-25_14-59-32.png?version=1&modificationDate=1653508773595&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
            
            1.  **Cancel** \- Click **Cancel** to cancel the process of generating the cut list.
            2.  **Include cut item** \- Click the **Include cut items** button to include parts that have already been cut. This is used to recut parts.

## Generate T-Drill Cut List

## Import Cut List - Upload the file that contains the cut lists

To import a cut list from a .CSV or .TXT cut list file your STRATUS administrator must first configure an **[Import Mapping](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/170196993/Import+Mappings+Admin)** under **Admin > Company > Import Mappings.** This configuration defines your import file header row and maps the data fields. The actual cut list file you select below must conform to the Import Mapping settings. **Note**: The .CSV or .TXT file must include a column whose header is Size and another column whose header is Length.

1.  From a Package Detail, click the **Cut Lists** tab.
2.  Click the **Import Cut Lists** button. 
3.  Select the **Upload the file that contains the cut lists** option.
4.  Click the **Browse** button and locate the cut list file to be uploaded.   
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/166723746/image2018-8-14_14-4-34.png?version=1&modificationDate=1534273476794&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=270&height=396) 
5.  This file must conform to the Import Mapping setting under **Admin > Company > Import Mappings.** STRATUS will recognize whether it is a CSV or TXT file type and select the correct Import Mapping.
6.  Once the cut list file has been uploaded, click the **Import** button and the cut list will display. In this case, 2 cut lists for 2 different sizes were imported.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/166723746/image2018-8-14_14-6-46.png?version=1&modificationDate=1534273608449&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=432&height=98)
7.  You can either:
    1.  Click the **Print Labels** button to print to a ZPL printer, or,
    2.  If you have a TigerStop, select a Station, check one or more cut list rows, and then click the **Send Cut List to Station**. 

## Import Cut List - Select the report that contains the cut lists

To import a cut list from a .CSV or .TXT cut list file your STRATUS administrator must first configure an Import Mapping under **Admin > Company > Import Mappings.** This configuration defines your import file header row and maps the data fields. The actual cut list file you select below must conform to the Import Mapping settings. **Note**: The .CSV or .TXT file must include a column whose header is Size and another column whose header is Length.

1.  From a Package Detail, click the **Cut Lists** tab.
2.  Click the **Import Cut Lists** button. 
3.  Select the **Select the report that contains the cut lists** option. Select a report in the drop-down list. If you have more than one import mapping, select the import mapping that was configured to be used with the report.

### Lightning Catalog Parts

The **Add Lightning Catalog Parts** button and dialog has been added to the Packages > Viewer > Parts data table. This feature is enabled when a model has been published along with its Fabrication database. Items from the Fabrication database catalog can be added to the package and automatically published.

**GTP Lightning application:**

-   Can be downloaded from the [**STRATUS Help**](https://www.gtpstratus.com/home/help) page.
    
-   Can be used with both STRATUS and Field Orderz to publish and synchronize Autodesk Fabrication databases to the GTP Cloud.
    
-   Enables Fabrication Services to be used by Field Orderz for sketching and fitting input.
    
-   Improves the speed of the STRATUS model publish process.
    
-   Enables STRATUS publishing for users without access to the Fabrication database.
    
-   Is used to add Fabrication Catalog parts to a package (see below).
    

To use the **Add Lightning Catalog Parts** feature:

1.  Before the **Add Lightning Catalog Parts** feature is enabled, the model’s Fabrication database must be published using the **GTP Lightning** app.
    
    1.  Download **GTP Lightning** from the [**STRATUS Help**](https://www.gtpstratus.com/home/help) page.
        
    2.  For more information about how to configure download and install GTP Lightning see the following article:

Stratus supports a web-based workflow for generating Total Station CSV point and DXF graphics files for hanger and other recognized points scoped out using packages.  To use the **Point Lists** feature the detailer will need to draw the model with points that are designated as **Anchor** or **Positioning** points (in Revit), and your Admin will need to setup a Total Station tool and a jobsite station (in Stratus).

Each station in Stratus will correspond to real hardware that you will upload your point lists too. In addition, the package must include hangers for the **Point Lists** > **Generate Point List button** to be enabled.

-   5 [Videos](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166821968/Package+Point+List#Videos)

**To configure a Total Station Tool and a Station:**

1.  Under Admin > Company > Tools, click **New Tool** and select the **Total Station** Type.
    
2.  Under Admin > Company > Stations, click **New Station**. In this example, the station will be named “Total Station 1”. Select a **Division** that will receive the points on a Total Station. Select the Total Station **tool**.
    

## Create Points for Point Lists in Revit

Points added to a point lists:

-   Point elements (Ex. embedded or nested GTP/Trimble/Evolve point families) must be visible in the source Revit view when published to Stratus.
    
-   _Only get added if they have the correct Point Type._ Point Type is set in your authoring tool. Point Types that get added to point list are **Anchor** or **Positioning**. In the following example, a hanger family type in Revit will be modified to adjust the top point, ensuring it is a Point Type that meets the criteria for inclusion in a point list.
    

1.  In Revit, edit the Revit Family, then edit the sub-part to set the “Point Type” on a hanger:
    
2.  Next select the anchor point:
    
3.  Edit that sub-element (the part that will be the point of interest) and set the Point Type to “Anchor”.
    
4.  After saving this file:
    
    1.  Load the sub family back into the family
        
    2.  Save the family.
        
    3.  Load it back into the model.
        

## Generate Point Lists in Stratus

To Generate Point Lists:

1.  Add the hangers or other parts including points into a package in Stratus under Models > Viewer > Actions > Packages. Points added to the point list are filtered based on point type.
    
2.  Once the package tracking status is locked down by assigning a status that does not allow ‘Can Package’, go into the package details page and open the **Point Lists** tab.  Click the **Generate Point Lists** button.
    
3.  After the point list is generated, make sure the correct Station (Total Station 1) is assigned. Then, click the checkbox for the point list, and then click the **Send Point List to Station** button.
    
4.  Next, click the **Jobsites** menu item and locate the correct station (Total Station 1).  Notice the #Point Lists assigned value is 1 in this example.
    
5.  Once in the Total Station Tool tab you can view the Queued Items and will find the point list from the listed package.  
    
6.  Click the **download** button at the right to **extract the CSV and DXF files** for this point list.  Note: If prompted to allow multiple file downloads, click Yes. The status can be manually updated in this view as well from In Progress to Complete.
    
7.  The resulting points CSV file will look similar to the following:
    
8.  The resulting DXF file will be a subset of the overall model, only containing content within the region of the package definition.  It will display grid lines, centerlines for recognized systems, and point symbols, similar to the following:
    

## Coordinate System

For Revit models that have a shared coordinate transformation, users now have the option to export the CSV and DXF for the Total Station tool using either Shared or Model (Project Internal) coordinates on a per project basis.

To set the Coordinate System:

1.  Under **Admin** > **Project** > **Settings**, select the **Coordinate System** and Save.
    
2.  To export the CSV and DXF files for a point list, see the Configure a Total Station Tool and a Station and   
    Generate Point Lists sections above.

See the [**Duration Days Company Level Configuration**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351/Package+Categories+Admin#PackageCategories(Admin)-DurationDays) article for more information. ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/260603982/image2022-5-18_15-40-5.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652906410090&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1000&height=333)
    2.  At the Project level under Admin > Projects > Settings. See the [**Duration Days Project Level Configuration**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217907482/Settings+Project#Settings(Project)-DurationDaysProjectLevelConfiguration) article for more information.  
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/260603982/image2022-5-18_15-39-24.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652906365397&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=469&height=250)
2.  For the Duration Day to be applied to a package during the create package process:  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/260603982/image2022-5-18_15-37-20.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652906241948&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=350&height=669)
    1.  **Package Category (required) -** The package category that includes Duration Days for one or more phases must be selected.
    2.  **Phase (optional)** - Phase defaults to **On Site**, but can be changed to a particular Phase. Selecting a phase will only denote which Start Date will be set with the Start Date entered (below). Initial Start Dates will populate the other Phases based on the Duration Days calculations.
    3.  **Start Date (optional)** - The Start Date is used to set the Start Date of the selected Phase.  If a Start Date is not entered, all Phase Start Dates will be empty.
        1.  The meaning of **On Site** is defined by your company.
        2.  On the Packages > Dashboard, the **Required Date = On Site** date.
    4.  **Note: Duration** - If the Package Category selected includes Duration (days), then those Phase Start Dates will be calculated based on the Start Date of the selected Phase (#2).
3.  New Package Creation
    1.  **Phase Start Date** - After the new package is created that includes a Phase Start date, the **Link Phase Calculations** toggle is **off** and users can manually change any individual setting (Ex. Start Date, End Date, or Duration), but this change will not impact other dates or settings. In addition, no date or phase is has the radio button selected to lock the setting.![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/260603982/image2023-6-23_11-4-59.png?version=1&modificationDate=1687536300568&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    2.  **No Phase Start Date -** After a new package is created that does not include a Phase Start date, the **Link Phase Calculations** button, under the Package’s > Properties > Planning button, will default to On (Enabled) rather than Off (Disabled). This way, when dates are entered in the Planning table, they automatically calculate without having to remember to enable the **Link Phase Calculations** button.  
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/260603982/image2023-9-22_8-18-3.png?version=1&modificationDate=1695388684618&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
4.  **Link Phase Calculations** toggle to **on** - Click the **Link Phase Calculations** toggle to **on** when you want to base all phase dates off a date or duration change. For each change made in the Planning table, all of the phase dates will be updated based on that change.  
    **Note:** The **Link Phase Calculations** toggle button can be toggled on or off for each individual user but any updated dates or durations display immediately for all users.![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/260603982/image2023-6-23_11-5-52.png?version=1&modificationDate=1687536353870&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
5.  **Reset Planning Dates** - The **Reset Planning Dates** button is now on the Packages Dashboard making it easier to reset planning dates to the default. This button is still in the Planning table under Properties for each package.![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/260603982/image2023-6-23_11-7-7.png?version=1&modificationDate=1687536428752&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
6.  **Packages Dashboard** - Editing a package in the Packages Dashboard will adhere to individual package settings for date/duration locks and **Link Phase Calculations**.
7.  Start Date, End Date, and Duration can be edited:
    1.  Under Packages > Schedule by editing the values of the Gantt chart. 
    2.  Under Packages > Properties > Planning in the Planning section (this article).
    3.  Under Packages > Dashboard when a report is configured to use the STRATUS.Package.\*Duration and STRATUS.Package.\*StartDT fields.

Edit Planning Section

A package’s Start Date, End Date, and Duration (days) can be manually edited in the Planning section of the Package’s Properties tab. Any edits will also update the Packages > Schedule after the page has been refreshed. Similarly, any changes to a Phase Start Date, End Date, and Duration (days) on the Packages > Schedule page will also update the Planning section after the page is refreshed.  **Note:** The **On Site** date is not editable under Planning, however, it is editable by editing the Required Date on the Packages Dashboard (Default report).

Only two values are editable at any one time (denoted by the blue circle). Below are the three ways to edit a Phase.

1.  To calculate the End Date:
    1.  Set the Start Date and Duration to be editable.   
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/260603982/image2022-5-14_14-2-3.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652554924829&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=863&height=250)
    2.  Change the Duration or Start Date. In this example, the Duration is changed from 2 to 10. 8 week days are added to the End Date which changes from 12/1/2022 to 12/13/2022.  
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/260603982/image2022-5-14_14-26-25.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652556387014&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=884&height=250)
2.  To calculate the Duration:
    1.  Set the Start Date and End Date to be editable.  
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/260603982/image2022-5-14_14-1-25.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652554887739&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    2.  Change the End Date or Start Date. In this example, the End Date is changed from 12/1/2022 to 12/7/2022. Given the Start Date, the Duration is calculated from 2 days to 6 days.  
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/260603982/image2022-5-14_14-25-31.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652556333020&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=838&height=250)
3.  To calculate the Start Date:
    1.  Set the End Date and Duration to be editable.  
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/260603982/image2022-5-14_14-20-51.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652556053626&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=850&height=250)
    2.  Change the End Date or Duration. In this example, the End Date is changed from 12/1/2022 to 12/19/2022. Given the Duration, the Start Date is calculated from 11/29/2022 to 12/15/2022.  
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/260603982/image2022-5-14_14-24-26.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652556267103&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=889&height=250)
4.  The Duration (days) Total - Displays the total number of workdays (Saturdays and Sundays) are not included.
5.  Estimated Hours - The Estimated Hours field can be used as needed but is not used in any calculation or report.

## Actual

The Actual data table is read-only and is directly related to the Admin > Company > Tracking Statuses for each Phase (Office, Purchasing, Shop, Field). See the **[Tracking Status (Admin)](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761/Tracking+Statuses+Admin)** article for more information.   
![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/260603982/image2022-5-16_15-52-1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652734323120&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=800&height=473)

-   **Start Date** - The Start Date for a Phase displays the date when the package's tracking status was changed to the tracking status associated with 0% for the Phase. All other percentages are ignored for the Actual table. 
-   **End Date** - The End Date for a Phase displays the date when the package's tracking status was changed to the tracking status associated with 100% for the Phase. All other percentages are ignored for the Actual table. 
-   **Duration (days) Total** - The Duration (days) Total displays the total number of workdays (Saturdays and Sundays) are not included.
-   **Install Date** - The Install Date field can be used as needed but is not used in any calculation or report.

Below is an example of the 0% and 100% tracking status associated with each Phase (Office, Purchasing, Shop, Field) under Admin > Company > Tracking Statuses.

    1.  **Attachments tab notes:** The selected report's STRATUS Sheet saved isometric view can also be displayed in a report on the Package's > Attachments tab. Here, the report can either be selected, or the report can be included as a sub-report of a Master report. In either case, the report content will display the isometric view as saved in the Package's STRATUS Sheet.
        

## Enabling Higher Resolution Views on STRATUS Sheets

There is a hidden setting we have that controls the resolution of this output.  We had some browsers incapable of rendering higher resolution quality and therefore set the default value rather low to ensure success for all users.  We have noticed some of you like to generate some larger sheets where having higher resolution 3D view images might be nice. Here is how to change the setting by simply modifying a value in your web browser. 

1.  In Chrome, I press F12 to open Developer tools, or you can access it from the menu as shown here (other browsers will have a similar option). 
    
2.  Once the Developer tools window is opened, find the ‘Application’ tab, then Storage \\ Local Storage \\ https://www.gtpstratus.com and type **gtp-stratus-max** into the filter or just sort by Key value and locate the entry.
    
3.  You can assign a larger value to the **gtp-stratus-max-webgl-canvas-width-height**, such as 10000 which is as high as we have tested.  If you start getting black boxes where the 3D views are, the value is too large.
    

## Videos

See the Packages Module Overview webinar [**CSG Webinar: STRATUS In-Depth Series, The Packages Module**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/3309693/Packages#01/28/2021CSGWebinar:STRATUSIn-DepthSeries,ThePackagesModule(1:01:57) "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/3309693/Packages#01/28/2021CSGWebinar:STRATUSIn-DepthSeries,ThePackagesModule(1:01:57)") for more information.

# Package Tasks - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> Task items are the instances of company defined task definitions, which belong to task workflows optionally assigned to assemblies and parts. Each task item knows the assembly or part to which it belongs and holds a reference to the user and/or station with start and completed time stamps. The Tasks tab can display a tasks Kanban board (To Do, In Progress, Done) for each package.  The task workflow is configured at the company level and enables a company to apply a task sequence to an order.

-   3[Generate Tasks](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/170688627/Package+Tasks#PackageTasks-GenerateTasks)

## Configure a Task Workflow

1.  **Task Categories** - Enter how your company wants to categorize tasks under **Admin > Task Categories**. Task Categories which are used to categorize Task Definitions like Bending, Cutting, Detailing, Installing, etc.  Below is an example. 
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/170688627/image2018-8-23_14-42-56.png?version=1&modificationDate=1535053378608&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=890&height=376)
    
2.  **Task Definitions** - Enter your company's Task Definitions under the **Admin > Task Definitions**.  Task Definitions are process tasks. You can make them as detailed or broad as you like.  Below is an example.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/170688627/image2018-8-23_14-50-18.png?version=1&modificationDate=1535053820030&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=901&height=321)
    
3.  **Configure your Task Workflows**. A task workflow is a sequence of tasks.  When tasks are generated under the package's **Tasks tab**, each task under Task Sequence will be assigned to part, assembly, or package and will display on a Kanban board.
    1.  **Name and Description** - Enter a task workflow name and description.
    2.  **Apply to Type** - Apply it to a type (part, assembly or package). Task workflows are assigned on the package's **Items tab** and each item in the package is identified as a part, assembly, or package. This setting helps filter the list so you won't be able to apply a task workflow to an assembly that is targeted to a part.
    3.  **Cost Category** - Set the Cost Category.
    4.  **Task Sequence** - Select tasks to be done for each item and then order them as needed. These tasks are defined under Task Definitions. Below is an example.
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/170688627/image2018-8-23_15-0-19.png?version=1&modificationDate=1535054421159&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=953&height=364)
        
4.  You are ready to assign tasks under the package's **Items tab**.

## Assign a Task Workflow to Items

1.  Click the **Items tab** which lists the items (parts and assemblies) that are included in the package.
2.  Assign each item to a Task Workflow. You can select multiple item checboxes and then select a Task Workflow for one of the checked items and all checked items will be set. Below is an example.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/170688627/image2019-10-7_8-55-47.png?version=1&modificationDate=1570456549110&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=755&height=250)
    

## Generate Tasks

1.  After you have assigned a Task Workflow to all the items, make sure the package tracking status has changed to a non-Can Package status.
2.  Click the **Task tab**. The Generate Tasks button will be enabled.
3.  Click the **Generate Tasks** button and the task will be created on the Kanban board.

**Task Color**

The task color comes from the Admin > Company > Task Category where each task category is associated with a color.  On the Admin > Company > Task Definitions page, a Task Category is assigned to a Task Definition. And then finally, on the Admin > Company > Task Workflow page, you assign tasks in the Task Sequence area which are associated with the Task Definitions.

## Default Report

The Default report is available out-of-the-box. Custom reports can be created and will display in the Report drop-down. See the Package Dashboard Reports example in the [**Reports (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393") article for more information.

## Columns

1.  **Package Number** and **Package Name** \- Open a package by clicking the Package Number or Package Name link. Opening the package will display the package tabs that enable you to work with the package (Ex. Viewer, Cut Lists, Tasks, etc.). The Package Number and Package Name were assigned to the package when it was created and can be edited by opening the package, clicking the Properties tab, and then editing the Name or Number fields. The Package Description, Category, Estimated Hours, Start Date, and Required Date can also be edited in the Properties tab for the package. A Package is created in the:
    
    1.  Models > Viewer page
        
    2.  Projects > Deliverables page
        
    3.  Packages Dashboard page when the **New Package** is used
        
2.  **Model** \- The name and link to the model from which the package was created.
    
3.  **Description** \- The Description of the package if entered.
    
4.  **Required** \- The Required date on the Default report, if known, is the date that the package materials are required to be on-site for the Field Phase Start Date. The Required date can be edited in-grid, or on the [**Package Properties**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/260603982 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/260603982") tab, or on the [**Packages Schedule**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/9044061 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/9044061").
    
5.  **\# Assemblies** - The number of assemblies in the package.
    
6.  **\# Parts** \- The number of loose parts (not found in assemblies) in the package.
    
7.  **\# Total Parts** - The total number of parts including loose parts and those in assemblies.
    
8.  **\# Tasks** - If a Task Workflow has been applied to a package, the # Tasks indicates the number of tasks that have been created for the package. See the [**Task Definitions (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/240713729 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/240713729") article for more information.
    
9.  **% Complete** - % Complete is calculated differently depending on whether the package includes tasks or not.
    
    1.  **Package includes tasks** - When a package has tasks associated with its child assemblies or parts, the completeness of the tasks is used to calculate the % complete for the package.
        
    2.  **Package does not include tasks** - When the package does not have tasks, the % Complete calculation is based on the packages' tracking status percentages. See the [**Tracking Statuses (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761") article for information about how to setup % complete values.
        
10.  **Hours** **Estimated** \- Estimate Hours are manually entered when the package is created, except when the package is created from the Projects > Deliverables page. Estimated Hours can be edited in-grid. The editable Estimated Hours field uses the **STRATUS.Package.HoursEstimatedShop** property in both default and custom reports.
    
11.  **Actual Hours** - Actual Hours are manually entered when the package Tracking Status changes and the Update Tracking Status dialog displays. Actual Hours can be applied to a Part, Assembly, or Package and the tracking log hours now bubble up to the package level. For example:
    
    **If a part and assembly belong to a package and actual hours are entered:**
    
    Part = 1; Part = 1.5; Part = 3; Part = -2  
    Assembly = 5; Assembly = 7  
    Package = 10  
    Packages Dashboard = 35.5
    
    **If part and assembly are in two different Package Categories and actual hours are entered:**
    
    Part = 1; Part = 1.5; Part = 3; Part = -2  
    Assembly = 5; Assembly = 7  
    Package = 10  
    Packages Dashboard for both packages = 35.5
    
12.  **Division** - The Division can be entered when the package Tracking Status changes and the Update Tracking Status dialog displays. The Division can be edited in-grid.
    
    1.  The default settings for Division when creating a New Package, under Packages Dashboard and clicking the New Package button, will be the user’s last setting for Division.
        
13.  **Status** - The Tracking Status can be changed (in-grid) by clicking the Status link which will display the Update Tracking Status dialog.
    
    1.  The default settings when creating a New Package, under Packages Dashboard and clicking the **New Package** button, will be the user’s last setting for Status.
        
14.  **Job**
    
    1.  If a MAJ or PCF file has been generated, the Job column will display.
        
    2.  A download button and create date will display if a .MAJ has been generated.
        
    3.  Click the download icon and your web browser will prompt you to save the file. A .MAJ file contains both fabricated and non-fabricated items that are part of the package.
        
15.  **Attachments**
    
    1.  The **Upload Attachment** button can be used to locate and upload attachments to any package on the Packages Dashboard. See the [**Add Attachment**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2081619969/Attachments#Add-Attachment "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2081619969/Attachments#Add-Attachment") section in Attachments article for more information.
        
    2.  Clicking the **Open Attachment** button will display the attachment fly-out.

For information on automatically generating a .MAJ see the [**Generate Automated .MAJ CamDuct Cut List File**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166723746#PackageCutLists-Automated.1 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166723746#PackageCutLists-Automated.1") article.
            
        5.  For information on automatically generating a .PCF file, see the [**Generate Automated .PCF PypeServer Cut List File**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166723746#PackageCutLists-Automated "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166723746#PackageCutLists-Automated") article.
            
        6.  Custom Data Fields - STRATUS custom data fields can be included in a .MAJ file.
            
            1.  A custom data field is published and edited.
                
            2.  A MAJ file can be generated and opened with edited custom field on parts:
                
    2.  **Reset Planning Dates** - Click the **Reset Planning Dates** button to reset all planning dates to their default values.
        
    3.  **Toggle Archive Status** \- Use the Toggle Archive Status to archive selected packages. By default, the Toggle Archive Status button will only be permissioned (visible) to users who have the Project Admin role. When clicked, the **Toggle Package Archive Status** prompt will display.
        
    4.  **Delete** - Click the **Delete** button to delete the package. All parts and assemblies will be disassociated from the package.
        
17.  **Totals** - By default, numeric columns (Integer and Decimal which includes # Assemblies, # Parts, # Total Parts, Tasks, Estimated Hours, and Actual Hours) are totaled. In addition, Feet Inch totals can be added to a custom report by configuring the report’s Total Values setting to Yes for the target columns. See the Package Dashboard Reports example in the [**Reports (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393") article for more information. 
    
    1.  All Dashboard pages that have more than one page of data will include 2 totals. In this case a subtotal (150.29’) for the packages on the page, followed by the total for all packages (24226.2’) defined by the Project and Model selected.
        

## Filter and Sort the Dashboard

### Filters

**Filter the dashboard by one or more of the following:**

-   Filter by one Project or All Projects.
    
-   Filter by one Model or All Models.
    
-   Filter by one or more Divisions (defaults to ALL Divisions).
    
-   Filter by one or more Statuses (defaults to ALL Statuses).
    
-   Filter by one or more company package Categories (defaults to ALL Categories).
    
-   Filter by using the **Search** option which searches the package by name, number, model, required, Division, or tracking status. In addition, if search criteria is entered while the Packages Dashboard is loading, any packages matching the criteria will immediately display at the top of the table.
    
-   Filter the dashboard content by clicking a **Filters** button in the column header, then click the filters arrow that displays, and then select use the selection interface to filter the list. See the [**How does the column filter work?**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/452919459/Sort+and+Filter+Data+Tables#How-does-the-column-filter-work%3F "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/452919459/Sort+and+Filter+Data+Tables#How-does-the-column-filter-work%3F") article for more information.
    

When a filter criteria finds no results the following message will display:

1.  Assemblies > Dashboard
    
2.  Packages > Dashboard
    

To filter to packages that do not have a Required Date:

1.  Click the **Filter** button. A filter will display.
    
2.  Click the red x for both fields. Empty Required Dates will display.
    

### Date Window Filter

When enabled the date window filter will filter the dashboard data table to items whose date is a specified number of days before and after the current date. This tool is targeted at those who prefer to view packages within a consistent date range window every time the page is loaded. These settings will persist on the Packages Dashboard, Schedule, and Status Board until they are changed on any page or turned off.

**To use the Date Window filter:**

1.  The Date Window filter is off by default.
    
2.  Click the Date Window filter button to display the dialog.
    
3.  Click the gear icon to display configuration options.
    
    1.  **Include empty dates**
        
        1.  **Checked** - When checked if an item’s date field is Empty, it will display in the data table.
            
        2.  **Unchecked** - When unchecked if an item’s date field is Empty, it will not display in the data table.
            
    2.  **Count Days as**
        
        1.  **Business** - For the business day calculation, weekends are excluded while public holidays are included as a business day.
            
        2.  **Calendar** - For the calendar day calculation, all days are included.
            
4.  To configure the date window:
    
    1.  **Date drop-down** - The Date drop-down displays all planning date fields located under Packages > Properties > Planning. **Note**: The Default is the Required date which also displays on the Packages > Dashboard default report. Select one date field.
        
    2.  To select the number of days prior to today, click the number and either enter a number or use the up/down arrow to change the value. The exact date the number references will display (hover text) as the number value changes. In this example, 10 days (business days) prior to today is 6/7/2022.
        
    3.  To select the number of days after today, click the number and either enter a number or use the up/down arrow to change the value. The exact date the number references will display (hover text) as the number value changes. In this example, 15 days (business days) after today is 7/12/2022.
        
5.  When done, the data table will filter to display only items that meet the criteria. Once set, these settings will continue to be used until they are changed.
    

### Sort

Users can manually sort a column heading by clicking the **Sort** button which will override the existing primary sort. See the [**Sort and Filter Data Tables**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/452919459 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/452919459") FAQ for more information.

-   **Click Sort button** - Any sort button has 3 states:
    
    -   **Click 1** - sorts the column in ascending order.
        
    -   **Click 2** - sorts the column in descending order.
        
    -   **Click 3** - sets the table back to the default sort order according to either the pre-defined table sort order (if one exists) or the sort order specified by the report’s sort index settings.
        
-   **Default Reports** - Default reports for the following dashboards include a default sort order. After a user manually changes the sort order for a dashboard, that sort order will override the default sort order and will continue to be the primary sort on that table for that user until the user changes it.
    
    -   **Packages Dashboard** \- Required date
        
    -   **Assemblies Dashboard** - Assembly Name
        
    -   **Container Dashboard**
        
        -   **Report** \- Container Type
            
        -   **Details Report** - Item Type
            
-   **Custom Reports (Sort Index)** - Report designers can specify a Sort Index for custom reports under Admin > Company > Reports > Report Fields. When a custom report is first loaded by a user, the Sort Index with the lowest number will be the primary sort. The next lowest index number will be a secondary sort when the primary sort includes identical values. Ex. If the table displays states, cities, and zip codes where state is sort index 1, city is sort index 2, and zip code is sort index 3, then, the primary sort will be state, the secondary sort will be cities which will be sorted alphabetically, and zip codes will be the third sort when there is more than one city.
    
    -   **Note**: After a user manually changes the sort order for a dashboard, that sort order will override the default sort order and will continue to be the primary sort on that table for that user until the user changes it. The lowest sort index will become the secondary sort, and so on.
        
-   **Reset Sorting** - Another way to sets the table back to the default sort order is to click the **Reset sorting** button.
    

## Display Active or Archived Packages

Once archived:

1.  The package will not display on the Packages Dashboard unless the Archived tab is selected. Use the Status "Active" or "Archived" filter in the Package dashboard.
    
2.  If an archived package is opened, only the Properties tab will display and all Properties will be disabled, except the ability to uncheck the Archived option.
    
3.  An archived package will display in the Models > Viewer under **Display Modes** and **Filters** where the Archived lable displays along with a hyperlink to the Package’s Properties page.
    
4.  Also on the Models > Viewer, with the **Actions > Packages** panel open, when an archived package is clicked it will display the **Archived** label and include a link to the package.
    

## Cached Calculated Values

Calculated field values are automatically cached and purged for each package. Package Dashboard cached values are automatically purged when:

-   any type of update changes values, such as editing parts in a package or assembly
    
-   using a field that is a total value from all parts in the package
    
-   a Field references a Part property, or another Field value and they are modified
    

**Clear Cached Calculated Field Values and Reload Data Table**

The **Clear Cached Calculated Field Values and Reload Data Table** button forces calculated values to be refreshed. This button should only be needed as a backup as the Packages Dashboard will detect when calculated fields need to be refreshed.

## Paging

The Packages Dashboard uses Paging to load the data table. When the Packages Dashboard initially loads, all Package Names and non-calculated fields will load first. Calculated data will continue to load and replace skeleton placeholders on the dashboard until all data is populated. The benefit is that while data is populating, functions like sorting, filtering, package links, generate MAJ, update Status, and edit fields are available. When a non-calculated column is used as a filter, packages at the top of the newly filtered dashboard will begin to load. Totals will continue to update as row values are calculated. The data table loading indicator (red bar) will display until all data displays in the data table.

## New Package

The New Package button is primarily used for non-modeled Field Requests. By creating a package and then attaching a sketch or document to the package, the normal package workflow can be used to track the package and assembly through the project. See the [**Field Requests**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/242974730 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/242974730") article for more information.

## New Package Prerequisites

Before creating a New Package when the "Add Assemblies and Parts" checkbox is checked, verify the following in the Models > Viewer. If unchecked, the prerequisites can be ignored.

1.  **Company Filter** – Verify that the Company filter that will be selected works.
    
2.  **Package Category** – Verify that the parts being added to the package are not already included in the same package category. **Note:** If any part/assembly is already included in the selected Package Category, the part/assembly will not be added to the package and you will not receive a confirmation notification.  See the [**Package Categories (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351") article for more information.
    
3.  **Tracking Status** – Verify that the filtered parts are in a "Can Package" tracking status. See the [**Tracking Statuses (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761") article for more information.
    
4.  **Area** – Verify that the target Area is included under Admin > Projects > Areas.  See the [**Areas (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742") article for more information.
    

## Create New Package

To create a new package from the Packages Dashboard:

1.  Click the **New Package** button. The New Package dialog will display.
    
    1.  **Category** - Select the **Package Category**. In this example, the resulting package will be hangers for a specific area and the selected Package Category does not include assemblies. As a result, if these hangers are part of an assembly, the assemblies will not be included in the package.  See the [**Package Categories (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351") article for more information.  **Note:** If any part/assembly is already included in the selected Package Category, the part/assembly will not be added to the package and you will not receive a confirmation notification.
        
    2.  **Number** \- When creating a Package in the Packages Dashboard, the default **Number** is derived from the Naming Convention configured by the Admin.
        
        1.  If the Package Name Naming Convention refers to information that does not require a part be selected (Ex. Date, Project Number) then those will automatically populate the **Number**. See the [**Naming and Numbering (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913") article for more information. 
            
        2.  If the Package Name Naming Convention refers to information where a part must be selected (Ex. BIM Area Abbreviation or System/Service), then you will need to manually enter the data now or at a later time.
            
        3.  **Incrementor Checkbox** \- The Incrementor checkbox can be used to ensure the number is unique. It is not required that Package Number be unique.
            
    3.  **Name** - When creating a Package in the Packages Dashboard, the default **Name** is derived from the Naming Convention configured by the Admin.
        
        1.  If the Package Name Naming Convention refers to information that does not require a part be selected (Ex. Date, Project Number) then those will automatically populate the **Name**. See the [**Naming and Numbering (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/164134913") article for more information. 
            
        2.  If the Package Name Naming Convention refers to information where a part must be selected (Ex. BIM Area Abbreviation or System/Service), then you will need to manually enter the data now or at a later time.
            
        3.  **Incrementor Checkbox** \- The Incrementor checkbox can be used to ensure the number is unique. It is required that Package Name be unique.
            
    4.  **Status** – Set the **Tracking Status** the package will be in once created.
        
    5.  **Division** - Set the package **Division** (if any) once it is created.
        
    6.  **Description** – Include a **Description** to clarify the package if needed.
        
    7.  **Phase** – Phase defaults to **Required Date**. Enter a **Required Date** to communicate with the project manager and shop.
        
    8.  **Add Assemblies and Parts** checkbox - Check the **Add Assemblies and Parts** checkbox to automatically add parts/assemblies that meet the Filter and Area selections below.
        
        1.  **Filter** – Select the single **Filter** to be used to isolate the parts/assemblies. See the [**Filters (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617224 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617224") article for more information. **Note**: Validate that the filter works in the model.
            
        2.  **Area** – Select the single **Area** the package will include. See the [**Areas (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103284742") article for more information. Below is an example of the Areas drop-down list. **Note**: Validate that the area works in the model.
            
    9.  **Estimating Information** - The **Estimating Information** data cannot be edited until parts are added to the package.
        
    10.  **Additional Fields** - The **Additional Fields** data cannot be edited until parts are added to the package.
        
2.  Click the **Create Package** button and the package will display on the Packages Dashboard and will include any entered Data and the number of Parts and Total Parts that were added to the package. No assemblies were added since the selected Package Category ignored assemblies.
    

## Download CSV or Excel

The Packages Dashboard for a project and model can be downloaded to a CSV file or an Excel file.

## Import CSV

A CSV file can be imported to either create new packages or update existing packages. This feature could be used in various scheduling scenarios where packages with start dates and other fields could be imported into STRATUS from a Project Scheduling tool that can output to CSV format.

**Note**: When importing a file back into STRATUS: 1) only a CSV file can be imported back into STRATUS, and 2) the Package Dashboard must be filtered to one project and one model for the **Import CSV** button to be enabled.

### File Configuration

A CSV file that will be imported using the Import CSV button can be created in several different ways. In the examples below, the 2 packages already exist.

**To Configure the file Format and Field Values**

1.  Create a file in one of two ways:
    
    1.  **Create a new file** \- Create a new file with the required field headers and then add any optional fields below.
        
        1.  **Package Number (Required)**
            
        2.  **Package Name (Required)**
            
        3.  **Id (Required)** - This field is required to be in the file, but should be left blank for new rows.
            
        4.  With only the required fields a comma-delimited CSV file might look like this where row 2 is a package that will be imported.
            
    2.  **Download an Existing CSV File or Excel File** \- Click the **CSV** or **Excel** button. The file will download the field headers and data associated with the selected Packages Dashboard Report. In the example below, the **Default** report was selected and includes 4 rows of data.
        
        1.  Open the File in Excel. The following fields display.
            
        2.  Open the File in Notepad or Notepad++. The following fields display.
            
2.  **Optional Fields**  
    The following optional fields can be added to the file. Optional fields that include data will update the package during the Import CSV process. Fields that do not include data will be ignored. The Field header name used in the CSV file will depend on the report format specified in the package dashboard, otherwise the STRATUS.Package.\* name will always work. See the Header section of the [**Report Fields**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393#Reports(Admin)-ReportFields "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393#Reports(Admin)-ReportFields") topic for more information.
    
    1.  **Description** \- The Description field is optional.
        
    2.  **STRATUS.Package.StartDT** \- The STRATUS.Package.StartDT will only be updated if it is a valid date-time value (Ex. 03/24/21).
        
    3.  **STRATUS.Package.Required or the Header name specified in the report format** \- The RequiredDT will only be updated if it is a valid date-time value (Ex. 03/24/21).
        
    4.  **STRATUS.Package.HoursEstimatedShop or the Header name specified in the report format** \- The HoursEstimated value must be a valid number or will be set to zero.
        
    5.  **STRATUS.Field.\*** **or the Header name specified in the report format** \- Any STRATUS.Field.\* value that is editable can be updated. Note: If the editable field is defined as a date-time format, a valid date-time value must be entered (Ex. 03/24/21).
        
    6.  **STRATUS.Package.CategoryName** \- If the STRATUS.Package.CategoryName field is not included, the Package Category named Default will be applied to new imported packages. **Note**: In this scenario, a Package Category named Default must exist. Out-of-the-box the Default Package Category does exist but it can be deleted or renamed.
        
    7.  **STRATUS.Package.Notes**
        
        1.  **Existing Notes** - Existing Notes will not be removed.
            
        2.  **Duplicate Note** - If a duplicate Note is found, the newest Note will not be added to the Packages Dashboard during the Import process.
            
        3.  **Multiple Notes** - Multiple Notes should be entered using a semicolon as a separator between notes.
            
3.  **Ignored Fields**  
    The following fields will always be ignored by the Import CSV process and will never be used to update a package.
    
    1.  **Model**
        
    2.  **#Assemblies**
        
    3.  **#Parts**
        
    4.  **#Total Parts**
        
    5.  **#Tasks**
        
    6.  **%Complete**
        
    7.  **Actual Hours**
        
    8.  **Division**
        
    9.  **Status (Active or Archived)**
        
    10.  **Tracking Status** \- Like other new packages, any new package included in the import file will be assigned the first available “Applies to Package” tracking status.
        
    11.  **Category** \- Category data is only used when constructing NEW packages, cannot modify this property.
        
    12.  **Category Abbreviation** - Category Abbreviation data is only used when constructing NEW packages, cannot modify this property.
        

### Import Process

For this example, to import a CSV file with one new package the following CSV file will be used. For additional packages, add rows to the file. The CSV file can be imported many times and only the new or updated information will be imported.

1.  If an Excel file was used to edit field values in the previous section, save the file as a CSV file format.
    
2.  **Enable / Disable Import CSV button** - On the Packages Dashboard, the **Import CSV** button will remain disabled until one project and one model have been selected. Neither ALL PROJECTS nor ALL MODELS can be selected.
    
3.  Click the **Import CSV** button.
    
4.  The Import Packages dialog will display. Click the **Browse** button and locate the CSV file.
    
5.  The Upload Packages CSV File dialog will display. Click the **Upload** button.
    
6.  Once the file has uploaded the Close button will be active. Click the **Close** button.
    
7.  The Import packages dialog will display again, this time with the CSV file ready to be imported. Click the **Import** button.
    
8.  Once the file has imported, the following message will display. Click the **OK** button.
    
9.  After the Packages Dashboard refreshes:
    
    1.  **Packages Dashboard -** The new package will display on the Packages Dashboard. Some of the data entered in the CSV file are highlighted on this page.
        
    2.  **Package’s Properties** - The STRATUS.Package.StartDT and STRATUS.Package.CategoryName fields display on the Package’s Properties tab along with the other CSV field data.
        
    3.  **Package’s Notes** \- The STRATUS.Package.Notes field displays on the Package’s Notes tab.
        
10.  **Note:** Like all packages, when a package is created via the Import CSV process, it will:
    
    1.  Display as an Activity under Admin > Company > Activities.
        
    2.  Display as a Notification.

-   There are multiple ways to Edit Start Dates or End Dates in the Schedule:
    
    1.  **Package > Properties > Planning (Recommended)** - The most Lead Day information is available in the Package’s Planning area and is the best place to edit dates.
        
    2.  **Click and drag the entire Gantt bar** - To change the Start Date and End Date simultaneously, move the cursor over the bar and then click and drag the bar to the new date.
        
        1.  **Note**: If the Phase to the right (Ex. Shop) is locked (see the lock icon), then the Phase to the left (Purchasing) cannot be moved.  
            ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/9044061/image2021-8-9_15-31-22.png?version=1&modificationDate=1628541084332&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1000&height=301)
            
    3.  **Click and drag the left edge (Start Date) or right edge (End Date)** - Hover over the left or right edge until the cursor changes to horizontal arrows.![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/9044061/image2021-8-11_8-26-3.png?version=1&modificationDate=1628688364543&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=372&height=39)  
        
    4.  **Edit** **Start Date or End Date Column Field** - Double-click the phase Start Date or End Date, edit the date by entering the date or using the calendar, click a different row to save. The Gantt chart will update.   
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/9044061/image2021-8-11_8-37-58.png?version=1&modificationDate=1628689080223&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=380&height=250) 
    5.  Once a date has been changed from the Schedule, refresh the Package’s > Properties > Planning page to display the updated information.

The Status Board displays each package as a card on a Kanban board.

-   1[Packages Status Board](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8781921/Packages+Status+Board#PackagesStatusBoard-PackagesStatusBoard)
    -   1.1[Color Code Cards](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8781921/Packages+Status+Board#PackagesStatusBoard-ColorCodeCards)
-   2[Videos](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8781921/Packages+Status+Board#PackagesStatusBoard-Videos)

## Packages Status Board

The column headers are taken from your company's Tracking Statuses. Tracking Status updates can be made on this board by moving a card from one column to another. The tracking status for all assemblies and parts included in the moved package will update.  Each card contains information or links to information including:

-   **Package Name, View Details (Link)**
-   **Project Name**
-   **Due Date** - Targeted Due and calculated number of days until due
-   **Hours** - Estimate and Actual
-   **Tasks and Percent Complete** - Number of Tasks, Number of Tasks Done, the percent of tasks complete, number of Assemblies, and number of Parts.

1.  After a Division has been added to a package, the package will display on the **Packages > Status Board**. Here you can move individual package cards on a Kanban board (Issued for Fabrication, Issued for Purchasing, Purchased, etc.) to update the Division's queue. Each card includes Package details and links to package information.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/8781921/image2018-7-30_15-54-32.png?version=1&modificationDate=1532984074243&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=848&height=386)

## Open Package in the Packages > Viewer

There are several ways to open a package in the Packages > Viewer.

**Note**: STRATUS will recognize when users are working with a package and store the last opened or refreshed package as the active package. As a result, when the user clicks a link to an assembly, the active package will carryover and be selected in the Package drop-down. Otherwise, the Package will be set to Unspecified.

## Open Package from the Models Viewer

1.  In the Models > Viewer the Project and Model are selected.
    
2.  Under Filters > Packages, click the link to the package.
    
3.  The package will display with the same Project, Model, and Package selected. In Package's Details, if **Items** is selected as the default tab, then any of the package's Assemblies and Parts will display.  
    **Note**: In the Assemblies section, an assembly link can be clicked to open the assembly in the Assemblies > Viewer with the same Project, Model, and Package selected.
    

## Open Package from the Packages > Dashboard

1.  In the Packages > Dashboard, the Project and Model or ALL MODELS is selected.  **Note**: In this example, there are not additional filters for Division, Status, or Category.
    
2.  Click either the **Package Number** or **Package Name** link. **Note**: In this example, the Default Report is displaying.
    
3.  The package will display with the same Project, Model, and Package selected. In Package's Details, if **Items** is selected as the default tab, then any of the package's Assemblies and Parts will display.  
    **Note**: In the Assemblies section, an assembly link can be clicked to open the assembly in the Assemblies > Viewer with the same Project, Model, and Package selected.

## Viewer Filtering

Once a package is opened, other packages can be located using the filtering options including drop-downs for Project, Model, View, and Package.

## Project

To locate a package in a different Project:

1.  Click the **Project** drop-down and either select the project or search for the project and the Packages > Dashboard will display.
    

## Model

To locate a package in a different Model within the Project:

1.  Click the Model drop-down and either select the model or search for the model. 
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/6467ccf6-0c9a-475f-8a7c-25dad5381ff9)
    
2.  When switching to a new model, STRATUS will not know which package you intend to open. Therefore, the first package (alphabetic) will be selected. If the model does not have a package, the Packages > Dashboard will display.
    

## View

By default, all published models include a 3D view. The person who publishes the model can select additional views including 2D views. 90% of the time the default view in the Packages Viewer will display the needed information. In some cases, like risers, the default view may not include all of the model parts and will need to be overridden.

**To change the view to a 2D View:**

1.  The model must be published with a 2D view.
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/b7229f3a-6f82-4c08-8f12-0c50000801af)
    
2.  Select the 2D View and Click Ok when prompted. The 2D View will display. The following options available in a 3D View will be removed: STRATUS Toolbar, Search, Cube, Autodesk Toolbar features (Orbit, Model Browser, etc.).

### Package Viewer - View PDF Attachment

The Package's Viewer provides the ability to view a PDF attachment. This feature is useful for non-modeled packages. To use this feature:

1.  Under the Package’s > Attachments tab, attach one or more PDFs.
    
2.  Under the Package’s > Viewer tab, the PDF(s) will display. Use the View drop-down to view different PDF’s.
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/74f82920-75ff-4970-af97-908233a8611e)
    

## Package

See the [**Open Package from Package Drop-down**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/199983153#PackagesViewer-OpenPackagefromPackageDrop-down "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/199983153#PackagesViewer-OpenPackagefromPackageDrop-down") section.

## 3D Viewer - Expand / Collapse

By default, the Packages > Viewer tab displays the 3D Viewer (left) and the package’s detailed content tabs (right). Clicking the expand to full screen button in either section will change both sections to full screen, one stacked on top of each other. 

Below are the mechanics of the Package Viewer expand / collapse feature:

1.  **Default View** - 3D Viewer (left) and package’s detailed content tabs (right) and expander/collapse buttons in both panels. Click a part or assembly in the viewer and it will be selected in the in the package’s detailed contents Items tab, or check an Assembly or Part in the Items tab and will be selected in the 3D Viewer.
    
2.  **Click the 3D panel expander** - The 3D View expands to full screen and the package’s detailed contents displays full screen below the 3D View. Click a part or assembly in the viewer and it will be selected in the in the package’s detailed contents Items tab, or check an Assembly or Part in the Items tab and will be selected in the 3D Viewer.
    
3.  **Click the collapse button in either the 3D Viewer or package’s detailed content tabs** - The default view will display. In this example, when the 3D View was expanded to full screen the user zoomed in on the assembly, added item numbers, and then collapsing the panels retained both.
    
4.  **Click the package’s detailed content tabs expander** - The package’s detailed contents display on top and the 3D view on the bottom. In this example, the BOM tab was clicked and the zoom and item numbers are retained from the previous example.

## Division

A **Division** is a name for a department, person, or group that processes work packages and is specific to your company’s workflow, and is used to filter data tables. The future vision for Divisions is to use divisions as discreet business units that most closely align to a single cost code or group of cost codes. A Division is required when defining a Station. See the [**Project Divisions (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2038333441 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2038333441") article for information about Project-level Divisions.

## Shop Dashboard

Initially, the Shops Dashboard displays the number of Cut Lists and Tasks for each Station. Under Admin > Company > Stations, each Station includes an assigned **Division** which displays in the Shop drop-down list (Ex. Pipe Shop). When a Shop has a task whose status is either "To Do" or "In Progress" it will display.

## Station Tasks
