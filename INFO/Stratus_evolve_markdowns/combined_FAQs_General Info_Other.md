## Stratus Apps Integration

Before STRATUS can be used with your BIM 360 account, you must activate the STRATUS App integration.

1.  Click the 9 dots, select **Account Admin**.
    
2.  Click the **Apps** tab.
    
3.  If the **Apps** tab does not display, you’ll need to request that the **Apps integrations** tab be enabled by sending an email to [jared.coelho@autodesk.com](mailto:jared.coelho@autodesk.com "mailto:jared.coelho@autodesk.com"). In your email include your company Account ID. 
    
4.  Once enabled, click the Apps tab, click the STRATUS app button, and then click the **Add to BIM 360** button. This will enable STRATUS to sync with Docs.
    
5.  Your STRATUS administrator can now add users to your STRATUS company and to a Project.

This video demonstrates:

1.  How a BIM 360 Docs administrator invites users to a BIM 360 project.
    
2.  How to invite the STRATUS team to a BIM 360 project (optional).
    
3.  How to change a user’s access to a BIM 360 project within BIM 360 Docs. Additional access permissions can be managed within STRATUS but are not part of this video.
    
4.  How to enable the Apps tab by sending an email to [jared.coelho@autodesk.com](mailto:jared.coelho@autodesk.com "mailto:jared.coelho@autodesk.com") and include your Account ID (a.k.a. Company Docs URL).
    

## BIM 360 Projects

STRATUS can synchronize BIM 360 project profile information to the STRATUS project.

**To create new BIM 360 Project:**

1.  Login to BIM 360 Docs, click the 9 dots and then select Account Admin.
    
2.  Click the Project tab.
    
3.  Click the **Add** button. The **Create Project Profile** dialog will display. During the link process, BIM 360 Docs project information populates fields like project job number, project type, address, and dates in STRATUS. If a BIM 360 Docs project has already been sync’d at least once with STRATUS, then, fields will only be sync’d to STRATUS when they are empty. STRATUS will not overwrite existing values using the Refresh Projects from BIM 360 button.
    
4.  Below is an example of BIM 360 Docs project information that can be sync'ed to the STRATUS project.
    
5.  Below is an example of BIM 360 Docs information in STRATUS.
    
6.  See the [**Projects (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/11534406/Projects+Admin "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/11534406/Projects+Admin") for more information.
    

## BIM 360 Users

## **Add people to the BIM 360 member directory**

1.  Login to BIM 360 Docs, click the 9 dots and then select **Account Admin**.
    
2.  Click the **Members** tab.
    
3.  Click the **Add** drop-down and select add people to the member directory.
    
4.  The **Add People to the Member Directory** dialog will display.
    
5.  Enter **email address**, follow the prompts, and click **Save**.
    
6.  Once added, these users will be available to any project admin who wants to add people to their project.
    

## **Add people a BIM 360 project**

1.  Login to BIM 360 Docs, click the 9 dots and then select Account Admin.
    
2.  Select the Projects tab.
    
3.  The Project Admin page will display.
    

5.  Alternatively, if you are already logged into the project, click the 9 dots and then select Project Admin.
    
6.  Either way make sure the Members tab is selected.
    
7.  The list of project Members displays.
    
8.  Click the **Add** button. The Add Project Members dialog will display.
    
9.  Enter the email addresses of the people you want to invite and then click Select.
    
10.  If you are inviting the STRATUS team to your project to support your installation, enter [STRATUS@gogtp.com](mailto:STRATUS@gogtp.com "mailto:STRATUS@gogtp.com") and click Select.
    
11.  The users will display on the Members page.
    
12.  For each user, assign a company, project role, and at least one service. The Document Management service is required to view published models.
    
13.  Then click the **Add to Project** button.
    
    **Invitation to join the project**
    
14.  An invitation will be sent to the people added to the project.
    
15.  A user **must click Accept** in the email they receive to join the project.
    
16.  Once the user accepts the invitation by clicking the link in the invitation, you will receive an invitation acceptance confirmation email.
    
17.  In addition to adding new members, you can also manage member’s project permissions on this tab. Your STRATUS administrator will configure more granular project roles and permissions within STRATUS.
    
18.  Similarly, in STRATUS, you’ll need to add users to project and set their project role for each project.
    

## Permission the Project Files folders and files

1.  Once a BIM 360 project has been created and BIM 360 users have been added to the project, you may need to permission the folders and / or files depending on how you have configured your document management system. If a STRATUS user has access to your BIM 360 but doesn't have access to the project, project folder, or model / drawing, then they will receive an Unauthorized error in STRATUS when they attempt to view the model.
    
2.  Click the 9 dots and select Document Management.
    
3.  The Plans folder limits the file types that can be stored in it, so STRATUS only allows publishing models to the Project Files folder.
    
4.  Click the **option list button** and select the **Permissions** option.
    
5.  The Folder Settings Permission tab will display. You can assign permission to individuals or you can create a project role and give the project role folder permissions.

## Mini Computer or Desktop Option

-   See System Requirements for specific details on recommended needs.
    
-   GTP has found the **KAMRUI GK3 Plus Mini PC 16GB RAM 512GB M.2 SSD, Intel 12th Alder Lake N95 (up to 3.4GHz) Micro PC, 2.5''SSD, Gigabit Ethernet, 4K UHD, WiFi, BT, VESA/Home/Business Mini Desktop Computer** to be a very reliable and low price point option for working in your shop.  
    
-   Dust Proof Keyboards are inexpensive and hold up well to the shop environment.
    
-   Corded or Wireless Mouse  
    

## Tablet Options

-   Surface Pro 7 or newer (standard with **TigerStop**) and recommended over iPads
    
    -   Surface Pro is widely used, however, only Surface Pro tablets with Intel processors are compatible with ZPL printers, whereas those with ARM CPUs are not.
        
    -   If using just the tablet we highly recommend using a mouse with the Surface Pro.
        
-   Apple iPad or iPad Pro 
    
    -   Note if choosing to use an iPad in the shop it is highly recommended that you also paid a mouse with the iPad for moving tags and dimensions.
        
-   Stylus Pen and keyboard (recommended)
    

## Zebra Label Printer

-   Windows is required to print labels using the Stratus Workstation and Stratus Print applications.
    
-   Recommended ZPL Printer
    
    -   **ZEBRA ZD421 Thermal Transfer Desktop Printer 203 dpi Print Width 4-inch USB ZD4A042-301M00EZ/**
        
    -   This printer offers both Thermal and Direct Thermal Printing options so it wins the GTP Stratus Customer Success stamp of approval. 
        
-   -   ZT410 - direct thermal printer 
        
    -   TLP2824 Plus - thermal transfer printer  
        
    -   ZT610 series - industrial 
        

## Scanner

To scan a tracking code, the scanner must be integrated with a computer. This is recommended for all work stations and logistics stations.

-   Industrial Grade Strength for a more durable scanner. 
    
    -   Alacrity Upgraded 2D Industrial Barcode Scanner
        
        -   Much more rugged for handling a shop environment. 
            

## Screen Recommendations

-   Mobile Stations - 43" +or- seems to be the sweet spot due to being closer to the screen while referencing Stratus. 
    
-   Wall Mounted Monitors - 60" monitors +or- seems to be the sweet spot here since these are typically mounted on the wall and above the work station 
    
-   4K monitors are recommended for a high resolution. 
    

## Mobile Station Carts 

Mobile Carts can be made out of any cart. We Have seen anything from Plastic Carts, Tool Chests and Nurse stands as mobile stations. The cost can range completely pending on your needs and desires. 

-   Perlegear Mobile TV Cart offers a great cart with a wide base for stability while keeping a low price point.
    

## UPS Power Supply 

Mobile Carts means the need for mobile power. With the low power draw from newer TV's and the mini computers do allow these to be smaller. Sizing these will be based on what hardware you are using and how long that will be away from shower power. Having these mounted to the bottom of a mobile station and cart also increases stability to your station.

# Export / Import CSV Data - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> Q:     How can I export table data to CSV or Excel File Format.

---
> **Q:**     How can I export table data to CSV or Excel File Format. 
> 
> **A:**     Most data tables include a **CSV** button and an **Excel** button. The exported data will include “All” entries regardless of number selected in the Show entries drop-down list for the table.
> 
> **CSV** - The CSV button exports the data table to the CSV file format. If you intend to import data back into Stratus, the file will need to be saved as a CSV file.
> 
> **Excel** - The Excel exports the data table to an Excel file. If you intend to import data back into Stratus, the file will need to be saved as a CSV file.
> 
> To Export table data:
> 
> 1\. The **CSV** and **Excel** download data table buttons display on many Stratus pages. Notice that **Loaded entries** inform you how many rows have loaded out of how many entries will be loaded.

> 2a. If you click either the **CSV** or **Excel** download data table button before all entries have been loaded, the following message will display.

> 2b. **Generate** \- If the user clicks the **Generate** button, a partial file will download indicated with (Partial) in the file name.

2c. **Cancel** \- Click Cancel to wait for all data table records to load.

> 3\. The file will either download to your Downloads folder or you will be prompted for the output format.
> 
> 3a. **Open with** - To Open with, select **Open with** radio button with Excel selected regardless of which button was clicked. If the CSV button was clicked in Stratus, the file will open in the CSV file format. If the Excel button was clicked in Stratus, the file will open in the Excel file format.
> 
> 3b. **Save File** -To save the file, click the **Save File** radio button. If the CSV button was clicked in Stratus, the file will save in the CSV file format. If the Excel button was clicked in Stratus, the file will save in the Excel file format.

> **Q:** How can I Import CSV table data?
> 
> **A:**     While many data tables can exported, only a few include an **Import CSV** button.

> 
> Assemblies > Dashboard
> 
> **Containers Example: To export the Containers to CSV:**

1.  **Download the CSV file** - Click the **CSV** button. The CSV is downloaded and can be opened.
    
2.  **Edit Existing Data and Import** - To edit existing containers for import, edit any data value except Division and Id. All Names must be unique. When done Click the **Import CSV** button. In this example, the Name in the highlighted row was edited.
    
3.  **Add a New Row** - To add a new row:
    
    1.  Add the data and leave the Id blank.
        
    2.  Click **Import CSV**. The new rows will display.
        
    3.  Click the **CSV** button to export the table and the new rows will have been assigned an Id.
        
4.  **Duplicate Id** - Copy a row, change the Name to a unique value, but duplicate an Id.
    
    1.  The row will be imported, however it will replace the row that previously had the Id.
        
    2.  After clicking CSV to export, you’ll see that CSG \_ Pallet \_ 005 which had the duplicate Id was overwritten to CSG \_ Pallet \_ 006 and takes over the Id.
        
5.  **Duplicate a Name** - Duplicate a Name and Import. An error similar to the following will display.

## Fabrication Job issue creating MAJ or PCF files from the Packages Dashboard

> **Q:**     What can be done about the Fabrication Job error received when I try to generate a MAJ or PCF file on the Packages Dashboard?
> 
> ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/246153241/image2019-7-2_14-30-53.png?version=1&modificationDate=1562095854634&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
> 
> **A:** A Fabrication Job error similar to the one above occurs when files are being created and the Fabrication dll displays "Oversized Parts" dialog popup for oversized patterns (below). The problem is that the files are created on the STRATUS server and users cannot interact with the dialogs.  Autodesk will update the Fabrication dll to supress popup dialogs like these in an upcoming release. Below is a work around until this release is made.

> 
> To work around this issue, modify your Fabrication Database and republish the model as follows:
> 
> 1.  Open the Fabrication database that the model is using with CADmep, ESTmep or CAMduct.
>     
> 2.  Select to the Manufacturing tab and ensure "Automatically use these setting without prompting" is check On.  
>     ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/246153241/image2019-7-2_14-56-54.png?version=1&modificationDate=1562097416168&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=612&height=489)  
>     
> 3.  Select **OK** to save the changes,
> 4.  Follow publish instructions for your environment:
>     1.  If in AutoCAD CADmep re-publish the model.
>     2.  If the model is in Revit, reload the fabrication database into the model by selecting "Settings" and "Reload Configuration".  
>         ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/246153241/image2019-7-2_15-0-41.png?version=1&modificationDate=1562097642861&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=638&height=583)
>         1.  Once the database is reloaded into the model, re-publish to STRATUS. Re-publish is needed as the ESJ contains a snapshot of the fabrication database.
>             
>         2.  You should now be able to create the output files from the Packages Dashboard without the error.

## Stratus Linked to HGG ProCAM

There are two pieces of the HGG software: the controller software directly connected to the HGG machine (UPC), and then the software running on a separate PC. This article is concerned with the second piece of software, HGG ProCAM.

## Get a Key for HGG to Talk to Stratus

Before HGG ProCAM can communicate with Stratus, you will need to create an access key in Stratus that is entered into HGG ProCAM. To do this, in Stratus, go to Admin > Company > AppKeys

To create a new App Key for use with HGG set the Partner App to “HGG ProCAM”, and pick a Run as User who elevated rights. The **Key** is the value pointed to by the red arrow below:

This value will be entered into HGG ProCAM.

Your physical HGG machine must be associated with a Tool and a Station in Stratus. To create a tool in Stratus, go to Admin > Company > Tools. See the [**Tools**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220225 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220225") article for more information. Below is an example. 

After creating a tool, you will need to create a Station. To do that, go to Stratus > Admin > Stations, and create a new HGG station that you associate with the tool earlier created.

## Configure Pipe Cuts

Configuration of HGG output relies on Admin > Company > Pipe Cuts settings, where the company's o-let hole sizes, connector bevel angles, etc. are entered. See the [**Pipe Cuts**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201490457 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201490457") article for more information.

## Configure Cut List Mappings 

A Cut List Mappings for each Part Template must be configured to tell Stratus which data fields to use.

**To configure a Cut List Mapping:** 

1.  Got to Admin > Company > Part Templates. 
    
2.  In the Parts section, select or search for Part Template Name.  
    
    1.  **Hint**:  To determine a Part Template Name, in any Stratus viewer, open the Properties tool, select the part, and then locate the Template Name.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/d4750862-c821-44e5-9938-882edf3cf710)
        
3.  **Select** the Part Template and then click the **Cut List Mappings** tab.   
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/e04c7108-af95-42c3-a0c6-ead08c248258)
    
4.  In the **Consider for Multi-Axis Cut Lists** section, select a part parameter from your database that contains the data for each field. The parameters that need to be selected will vary depending the type of part selected. 
    
    1.  **Straight Pipe** fields:  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/a19bbf22-33c1-4a54-a96d-88d45155a1f6)
        
    2.  **Saddle** fields:  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/be2d883a-6005-49e7-99fb-f0fd06483afe)
        
    3.  **Revit Family Content - Pipes Pipe Type (No Fabrication Content)**   
        **Create Project Parameters (Required)**  
        Stratus uses the Revit API to extract data from the model. Diameter and Pipe End Connector parameters must be defined in Revit as a project parameter so that the data can be injected into the part. The project parameter tells Stratus where to look for the parameter in your model.
        
        1.  Stratus uses the Inside and Outside Diameter.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/b9e2f1c9-a582-4f64-bb89-7dcf20637cfd)
            
        2.  Companies need to map a project parameter to the Segment and Sizes.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/4c8af707-fe1b-4a96-92a1-298ff80d96da)
            
    4.  **Revit Family Content – Shaped Nipple**   
        The Shaped Nipple is similar to the Pipes Pipe Type but an Olet Type also needs to be selected.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/3cbf982e-4ecc-432a-baee-502ca28877f5)
        

## Generate a .HGG output file

To generate a .HGG file: 

1.  Open a package that includes straight pipe along with Connectors, Saddles, or Olets. 
    
2.  With the package open, click the **Cut Lists** tab.  
    
3.  To enable the **Generate Cut List** button, check that the package is set with a “**Can Cut List**” tracking status. See the [**Tracking Statuses (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761") article for more information.
    
4.  Click the **Generate Cut List** button.  
    
5.  The cut list will display.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/75cadbdd-2bff-4aae-8f04-f4139123d43a)
    
    1.  For each cut list row that will be sent to a HGG ProCAM cutting machine, select the correct **Station.**  See the [**Station (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220408 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220408") article for more information.
        
    2.  Check the rows that will be sent to the station. 
        
    3.  Click the **Send Cut List to Station** button. 
        
    4.  Click **OK** on the Send Cut Lists dialog box.
        
6.  Cut List files are organized under the **Shops** tab.  
    
7.  On the Shops > Dashboard, select the **Shop.** A list of Stations for the Shop display.   
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/51a4287b-bba2-4a1f-b6cf-053b76c1a9c6)
    
8.  Click the **Station** name and a list of requested cut lists will display.
    
9.  Click the **Send to Tool** button associated with the Cut List. A HGG file will be created for each material-diameter combination.    
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/74bd35a8-bee1-4f2a-86f9-ca9f12a6be2b)
    
10.  The .HGG file will be a downloaded by your web browser.
    
11.  The Job Value in the .HGG file with the Stratus Package Name.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/e7d20dc5-f517-4b58-9c23-38d452245963)
    
    **How to use the .HGG file**
    
12.  Locate the downloaded .HGG  file and save it to a location that can be used by the HGG ProCAM software. 
    
13.  The CAD department loads the .HGG file into the HGG ProCAM software. 
    
14.  HGG ProCAM's tools can be used to prepare the pipe to be cut. 
    
15.  Auto-nest the cut list and HGG ProCAM will optimize nesting. 
    
16.  When ready the operator starts the cutting tool. 
    

## Generate a .HGG File after Using Spool Checker

When using Spool Checker under Assemblies > Assembly > Spool Checker Tool, modifications at either end of the pipe will be reconciled with relative dimensional references. For the initiated, lengths can be affected at either the C1 or C2 end. This means that length will be taken up or given on the correct end of the pipe depending on the locked part scenario you are dealing with in the Spool Checker. This delivers feature parity to ITM and Revit pipe for multi-axis pipe cut file generation.

You can see 2” being taken off of either end of what was originally a 60” part in the screenshots below:

# How to Fix Fabrication Parts that have Duplicate ID's - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> Autodesk Revit - STRATUS customers are receiving emails with models identified as having duplicate Fabrication IDs and requiring fixes prior to March 14th.

---
### **\* ALERT \* - Starting with STRATUS v7 release around March 14th, 2024, duplicate Fabrication IDs in Revit models will prevent model publishing.**

**Autodesk Revit - STRATUS customers are receiving emails with models identified as having duplicate Fabrication IDs and requiring fixes prior to March 14th.**

#### **What can you do???**

-   **For Revit 2021 and newer,** be sure to apply all available software updates from Autodesk and make sure you are at least on the versions as indicated in the support article **[Autodesk Support Notes](https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Duplicate-GUIDs-are-created-on-fabrication-elements-in-Revit.html___.YXAzOmdvZ3RwOmE6bzpmOTY2MTI1YThlYzM1MjJjOWE5MTFmOGQzOTNjNjUxNTo2OjRmZGQ6NWI1YjdlOTFmOTZlMjRlNWM1MzFjOGRiNjc1YmY3ZmM0OTEyMGQ4NjViMTk1ZDU1ZTEwNzQ0YzRlYTg1MWQ5MjpoOlQ)**, Once done, AUDIT your Revit projects.  The AUDIT command has been enhanced to fix duplicate Fabrication IDs. 
-   **For Revit versions older than 2019 and 2020**, upgrade to the latest patched version. Before contacting [Autodesk support](https://www.autodesk.com/support/contact-support) to request assistance with resolving the duplicate IDs issue in your Revit project, users should fix their ITM files, otherwise the issue will be re-occur. 

**[Autodesk Support Notes](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Duplicate-GUIDs-are-created-on-fabrication-elements-in-Revit.html)**

**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION**

For customers that used the settings change in the settings.json file for STRATUS to override the publish behavior currently to allow publishing of duplicate IDs, you may wish to undo that change on each computer for users who publish models to STRATUS.  This will ensure you catch models with duplicate IDs prior to the v7 release.  Once v7 is released, this override will no longer be used.

·         Open the Windows File Explorer

·         Enter **%appdata%** into the path bar and hit the enter/return key

·         Navigate to the GTP Software Inc folder and open it

·         Navigate to the STRATUS folder

·         Open the settings.json file in notepad

·         Set the following setting to **false** if it exists (if not, you can leave this file alone)

o   “AllowFabPartsWithDuplicateGuidsToPublish”: true

·         Save the file and close it

**Q:**    Can parts in Revit and CADmep models have duplicate ID's for Fabrication Parts?

**A:**    Yes, both Revit and CADmep models can have duplicate ID's for Fabrication Parts. Models that will be used for fabrication cannot include duplicate Id's, so the issue must fixed. Below there is a Q and A for resolving the issue in Revit and a separate Q and A to resolve the issue in CADmep. 

**Q:** Can a **Revit** model include duplicate Id's or duplicate UniqueId's?

**A:** Yes.  A defect existed in Revit that allowed multiple Fabrication Parts to share the same UniqueId in the model which could break downstream workflows such as creating Package MAJ or PCF files leading to missing or incorrect parts in the Fabrication file. The defect was patched in Revit 2019.2.2, 2020.1, 2021 and later versions to prevent the creation of duplicates, unfortunately there was no automated way provided to fix existing instances of duplicates in models. If a model that was originally authored in an affected version of Revit is upgraded to a newer version that does not contain the defect, the duplicates will unfortunately still exist. To ensure STRATUS is working with validated models this release introduces a check during STRATUS publish to ensure the model does not contain duplicates.

Autodesk has identified additional ways a duplicate GUID can be generated. GTP is working with Autodesk on more flexible ways to correct issues like this in future releases of supported Revit versions.

1.  **GUID may be stored on the ITM** - Some STRATUS customers have noted that their project started with Revit 2022 or later, after the defect was patched, yet they are still having duplicate GUIDs in their published models. Autodesk just informed GTP that the a **duplicate GUID may be stored on the ITM** itself, which results in new instances of those parts being created having that ID. 
    
    1.  **Resolution:** For version 2021-2024, see the support article **[Autodesk Support Notes](https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Duplicate-GUIDs-are-created-on-fabrication-elements-in-Revit.html___.YXAzOmdvZ3RwOmE6bzpmOTY2MTI1YThlYzM1MjJjOWE5MTFmOGQzOTNjNjUxNTo2OjRmZGQ6NWI1YjdlOTFmOTZlMjRlNWM1MzFjOGRiNjc1YmY3ZmM0OTEyMGQ4NjViMTk1ZDU1ZTEwNzQ0YzRlYTg1MWQ5MjpoOlQ).**
        
2.  **Revit Type Selector** - A certain sequence of steps with the **Revit Type Selector** can also result in duplicates and sets the GUID to 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.
    
    1.  **Resolution**:
        
        1.  For version 2021-2024, see the support article **[Autodesk Support Notes](https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Duplicate-GUIDs-are-created-on-fabrication-elements-in-Revit.html___.YXAzOmdvZ3RwOmE6bzpmOTY2MTI1YThlYzM1MjJjOWE5MTFmOGQzOTNjNjUxNTo2OjRmZGQ6NWI1YjdlOTFmOTZlMjRlNWM1MzFjOGRiNjc1YmY3ZmM0OTEyMGQ4NjViMTk1ZDU1ZTEwNzQ0YzRlYTg1MWQ5MjpoOlQ).**
        2.  GTP has provided a macro to address the affected parts. See section 3. Detect Duplicate UniqueIds Using a Revit Module
            
3.  **Moving/Copying parts** – **Moving/Copying parts** caused duplicated GUIDs
    
    1.  **Resolutions:** A fix was released for 2019 through current versions. See the support article **[Autodesk Support Notes](https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Duplicate-GUIDs-are-created-on-fabrication-elements-in-Revit.html___.YXAzOmdvZ3RwOmE6bzpmOTY2MTI1YThlYzM1MjJjOWE5MTFmOGQzOTNjNjUxNTo2OjRmZGQ6NWI1YjdlOTFmOTZlMjRlNWM1MzFjOGRiNjc1YmY3ZmM0OTEyMGQ4NjViMTk1ZDU1ZTEwNzQ0YzRlYTg1MWQ5MjpoOlQ).**
        

**STRATUS Message When Duplicate GUID Detected**

Starting on 5/4/23 with release 6.2.189, if any duplicates are detected the publish process will be aborted with a message similar to the following. 

![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/269680683/image2023-5-5_11-17-18.png?version=1&modificationDate=1683303439577&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

**Resolutions and Work Arounds**

If duplicates are detected, there are 3 options:

#### 1\. Deduplicate the ElementIds in the Revit model and Publish the Model

1.  After receiving the cancel publish message (above), review the latest Revit publish log file at: **%appdata%/GTP STRATUS Logs/Revit**
    
2.  Copy the ElementIds from the log file and paste them into the Revit model using the “Select by ID” tool.
    
3.  Deduplicate (delete and redraw) each ElementId. A new Id will be associated with the new part. **Note**: Some situations require extra steps to ensure that connected parts are not redrawn which could cause additional problems. One scenario where extra editing steps should be taken is the case where a part like an elbow is connected with a weld on one end, and a pair of flanges on the other, and the elbow’s PartGuid needs to be deduplicated, but the weld and flanges PartGuids are unique, and they are already part of a package or in a workflow where those elements should not have their PartGuid values modified. In this case, the following general steps can be followed to deduplicate the elbow or similar part:
    
    1.  Store the part's rotation / orientation, and the the ID of the parts(s) it is connected to.
        
    2.  Pin the elements it is connected to.
        
    3.  Cut the element.
        
    4.  Paste the element.
        
    5.  For each connection, reconnect. Verify that the orientation is correct.
        
    6.  Unpin the elements pinned previously.
        
4.  Save and republish the model when done.
    

Below is an example of a **GTP STRATUS Log** that includes ElementId’s.![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/269680683/image2023-5-5_11-20-1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1683303602415&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

#### 2\. Continue Publishing with Duplicates (Temporary)

For customers who temporarily accept duplicate UniqueIds, the .json publish configuration can be modified to allow Fab parts with Duplicate Ids to be published. This pathway will be eliminated in a future release in Q3 of 23'.

1.  Open settings.json at: **%appdata%/GTP Software Inc/STRATUS**
    
2.  Modify the file by adding the line "AllowFabPartsWithDuplicateGuidsToPublish": true as shown below. **Note**: The lines in your file might be different. Make sure you add a comma to the preceding line Ex… after the “Warning”):  
    "RemoteMinimumLogLevel": "Warning",  
    "AllowFabPartsWithDuplicateGuidsToPublish": true
    
3.  Publish the model. The existing MAJ or PCF file issues will continue.
    

#### 3\. Detect Duplicate UniqueIds Using a Revit Module

Separate from the duplicate UniqueId detection built-in to the STRATUS Addin, duplicate UniqueIds can be detected by running the application macro module below.

_**Update 5/12/23**_

1.  To create and use a Revit duplicate GUIDs Application Module, in STRATUS go to Help > Downloads and click the [**DuplicationCheck**](https://update.gtp.one/downloads/DuplicationCheck.zip "https://update.gtp.one/downloads/DuplicationCheck.zip") link.
    
    1.  **Note: If you downloaded the DuplicationCheck.zip file prior to 5/12/23 at 8:00AM CT, please delete it and download again as it has been edited.**
        
2.  Unzip and open the file. This is a .txt file that will be used to create an **Application Macro** in Revit so that duplicate GUID detection can be run in any Revit model.
    
3.  Open any Revit project.
    
4.  **To Create a New Module** - In Revit click Manage > Macro Manager > Application tab > Module and then paste the name **DuplicationCheck** for the Module name.

16.  When no duplicates GUIDs are found , the following will display.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/269680683/image2023-5-12_12-47-49.png?version=1&modificationDate=1683913670844&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    
17.  When duplicate GUIDs are found a message similar to the following will display.
    
18.  Once it is done, save or save as the project.
    
19.  If you re-run the DuplicationCheck macro, a message similar to the following will display depending on what kind of duplicate GUIDs were in the model.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/269680683/image2023-5-12_12-49-3.png?version=1&modificationDate=1683913744802&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    

**Q:**     Can a **CADmep** model include duplicate Id's?  And after selecting a part with the Properties panel open, why does the message "No data available in tabled" display?

![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/269680683/image2023-5-5_11-11-13.png?version=1&modificationDate=1683303074495&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

**A:** The issue is caused by duplicate Id's in the CADmep model. During the STRATUS publish process, Duplicate ID’s are filtered out so no data is published and no data will display under Properties.

To fix this issue in your authoring software, copy and replace the objects in AutoCAD to generate a new UniqueId.

**To copy ALL the CADmep objects in the drawing.**

1.  Type **MAPFILTER**
2.  When prompted, type **ALL** and **Enter**.
3.  When the dialog is displayed, select **Cancel**, this will create a selection set containing all the CADmep objects.
4.  Type **Copy**, when prompted type **P** for **Previous** then press **Enter**
5.  When prompted for a base point type **0,0,0** and press **Enter**
6.  When prompted for second point type **0,0,0** and press **Enter**
7.  Press **Enter** to Exit the command.
8.  A copy of all the CADmep objects has now been made.
9.  Type **E** for **Erase** and press **Enter**
10.  Type **P** for **Previous**, press **Enter** and **Enter** again to finish the command, this will erase the original selection set, i.e. the objects selected to copy, and you are left with the copied objects which all have new UniqueIds.

**To copy ONLY CADmep objects with duplicated IDs in the drawing**

First you'll need to identify which objects have the duplicated IDs, to do this use the Select Filter command to manually identify.

1.  Type **SelectFilter** and **Enter,** when prompted type **All** and **Enter**
2.  Configure the **Columns** to contain the **Item Globally Unique ID** by selecting the **Columns** button and adding the field to the right and press **OK**.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/269680683/image2019-12-4_9-39-9.png?version=1&modificationDate=1575473951455&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=739&height=420)
3.  Select all the entries in the dialog (highlight one entry and press **Ctrl A**)
4.  **Uncheck** the check box for one entry and all will entries will uncheck.
5.  Click on the **Item Globally Unique ID** column heading so that the entries are sorted and that the ones with duplications will be next to each other.
6.  Scan the list looking for duplications and **check** one of each duplicated entry.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/269680683/image2019-12-4_9-40-32.png?version=1&modificationDate=1575474035098&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=739&height=416)
7.  Once all entries have been identified and selected, press **OK** on the dialog. The entries will now be highlighted in the model.
8.  With the objects selected type **MASKVIEW** and **Enter**, this will isolate all the selected objects.
9.  You can now make a **Copy** of these by following from **Step 4** as detailed above.
10.  Type **SHOWALL** and **Enter** to restore the display of all the CADmep objects.

## **Q:** Where can I download the Stratus Print application?

**A:**   Download and install the [**Stratus Print**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2121400321 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2121400321") application.

## **Q:** What are the steps to print to a Zebra (ZPL) compatible printer?

**A:**   Stratus provides the ability to print labels with a Zebra printer for non-TigerStop cut lists like PypeServer and T-Drill.

1.  Check that you have the latest [**Zebra Setup Utilities for Windows**](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/printer-software/printer-setup-utilities.html#featureforoperatings "https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/printer-software/printer-setup-utilities.html#featureforoperatings").
    
2.  To print labels using a ZPL label printer, download and install the [**Stratus Print**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2121400321 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2121400321") application.
    
3.  Create a printer tool under **Admin** > **Company** > **Tools** and select the **ZPL printer** as the tool type.
    
    1.  You may need to **Edit the Label Template** to configure the label fields. If so, please submit a  [**Stratus Service Desk**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3") request. 
        
    2.  Example Label Fields, depending on your database, might include any of the following case sentitive fields.  
        Note: Not all of these fields are available for labels using the workflow. See [**Import Mapping**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/170196993 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/170196993") article for more information.

    3.  To print labels:
        
        1.  Launch the **Stratus Print** application.
            
            1.  The first time **Stratus Print** is used, configure it by clicking **Settings** and then select the **Company**, **Tool**, and **Label Printer**.
                
            2.  The Print Workstation application needs to be open whenever you want to print labels but can be minimized. Don’t worry if it is not opened when you send labels to be printed; the application will queue all requests and then print as soon as **Stratus Print** has been opened.
                
    4.  You can print PypeServer/3DPP cut list labels from the Package Cut List Page:
        
    5.  1.  **Define and Generate a Package Cut List.** For information on how to define a Package and Generate a Cut List, see the [**Package Cut Lists**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166723746 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166723746") article in the Stratus Knowledge Base.
            
        2.  Once a package cut list has been generated it will display on the **Packages** > **Package** > **Cut Lists** page. You can print labels from this page by clicking the **Print Labels** button**. Note**: The defined Station for this cut list is the PypeServer Station and not a station that handles TigerStop cut lists.
            
        3.  The Select Printer Tool dialog will display. This is the label printer tool defined under **Admin** > **Company** > **Tools**. Select your label printer and click **OK**.
            
        4.  The labels will print. Below is an example. **Note**: The label print order does not currently synch with the item order in the cut list. 
            
    6.  You can also print labels from the **Shops Tool** page:
        
        1.  To print labels from the Shops Tool page, you’ll need to send the cut list to the Shop Station by checking the cut list and then clicking the **Send Cut List to Station** button on the **Packages** > **Cut Lists** > **Cut List** page.
            
        2.  Once the **Send Cut List to Station** button is clicked, you can locate the cut list under **Shops > Shop** (Ex. PyerServer Station) **> Tool** (the ZPL printer tool defined above) **> Queued Items rows >** click the **Print Labels** button.
            
        3.  The Select Printer Tool dialog will display. This is the label printer tool defined under Admin > Company > Tools. Select your label printer and click **OK**.
            
        4.  The labels will print. Below is an example. Note: The label print order is not currently synched with the items in the cut list.
            
    7.  You can also:
        
        1.  define a label report under **Admin** > **Company** > **Reports** where **Format = ZPL** and check the **Package Viewer checkbox**.
            
        2.  These label reports can be run under **Packages** > **Viewer** > **Actions** > **Reports**.
            

## Q: How can the TigerStop label include the next part in the spool?

A: This feature works when the assembly has two parts in it: a straight pipe segment to be cut and a pipe fitting to put on the end of the cut pipe.  To configure, add the **fitting1** field to your **Admin > Company > Tools > Tool > Label Template**. Send the cut list to the TigerStop tool. When the straight pipe is cut the next part will display. Below is an example where FTG is the label for the next part:

## Q: What Label Fields can be included on a ZPL label?

A: Depending on your database, the following case sensitive fields are available.   
Note: Not all of these fields are available for labels using the workflow. See [**Import Mapping**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/170196993 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/170196993") article for more information.

## Q: How can the ZPL code be tested without printing a label?

A: 

1.  Under either:
    
    1.  Admin > Company > Tools > Label Template
        
    2.  Admin > Company > Report > Label Template
        
2.  Click the **Edit Label Template** button. A “Label Template for” dialog similar to the following will display.
    
3.  **Print Density** and **Label Size** should match the target printer's settings in order to the preview how the printed label will display.
    
    1.  **Print Density** - Select the dpi to be used for the label.
        
    2.  **Label Size** - Enter the dimensions of the target label.
        
4.  **Edit dialog (left)** - Enter the ZPL into the edit dialog.
    
5.  **Preview dialog (right)** - Edit will immediately display in the preview panel.
    
6.  When done editing the ZPL, click **Save**.
    

## **Q:** Is there a way to print labels for connected assemblies? 

**A:**   Yes, see the Stratus.Assembly.Connected Property section in the [**Reports (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10617393") article.

## **Q:** Is there a way to cancel a print?

**A:**   Yes, cancel the print job in the Windows print queue for the ZPL printer.  

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/c3abf675-09b8-4f4e-916e-c4f01b9c1461)

## **Q:** Is there a way to print labels with special characters? 

**A:**   Yes.

It is going to take some refactoring of your label template code. Please see the forum here for background: [Print characters with an acute in ZPL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29437279/print-characters-with-an-acute-in-zpl "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29437279/print-characters-with-an-acute-in-zpl")

Now the quick and dirty is to just add a “^CI28” to the top of your label template code to tell it to reference UTF-8 encoding.

Here is what it looks like when you do not use the ^CI28 line when there is an Ø in the label text in the size row as well as a value of one referenced description field :

And here when you do:

## **Q:** Is there a way to print labels using a sort order? 

**A:**   Yes. To control the order of labels printed in a ZPL report:

1.  Create or use a Stratus.Field.x that will be used to designate the sort order where it's Data Type = Integer and Default Value = Empty.
    
2.  Add the  Stratus.Field.x field to a dashboard report where the it can be populated with sort order values.
    
3.  Add the  Stratus.Field.x field to a ZPL report and set its Sort Index = 1.

## **Printing Labels Troubleshooting Steps**

If you get the following error, you will need to clear out your cookies by deleting this directory:

C:\\Users\\\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\\AppData\\Roaming\\EBWebView

where \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is the Windows user name.

## Common Configuration Problems

If your the ZPL won't print, consider the following steps:

1.  Make sure in Windows Settings Printers, that your ZPL is your default printer (go to step [Default Printer](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/edit-v2/2132574209#Set-as-Default-Printer "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/edit-v2/2132574209#Set-as-Default-Printer") Step [4](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/edit-v2/2132574209#Set-as-Default-Printer "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/edit-v2/2132574209#Set-as-Default-Printer") below)
    
2.  If you installed your ZPL printer directly from Windows, it won't work. In that case, uninstall and reinstall as per the following steps.
    
3.  Reinstall as Needed
    
    1.  Start and Stop your Print Spooler under Task Manager > Services.
        
    2.  Right click (or long-press on tablet) and stop, then start this service.
        
    3.  Install the ZPL Setup Utility. [https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/printer-software/printer-setup-utilities.html](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/printer-software/printer-setup-utilities.html)
        
    4.  Install your ZPL printer drives from the Zebra Setup Utility.
        
        1.  In Windows under Printers (see image below):
            
        2.  Uninstall your ZPL printer.
            
        3.  Then, using the Zebra Setup Utility, reinstall your printer.
            

## Set as Default Printer

4.  Set Default Printer
    
    1.  Set your ZPL printer as the default printer.
        

d. In Windows 11:

"Let Windows manage my default printer" is ON.  
Turn off (or toggle off) the setting "Let Windows manage my default printer".

5.  In Windows, under Printers, uninstall all unwanted printers from computer (many times, printing issues involve conflicting printer and print drivers).
    
6.  Print a test page from Windows (if that works, try from the Stratus Printer App as well)
    

### It Prints, but not from the Stratus Printer App

If you can print a test label from the Zebra Setup Utility, but not from the Stratus Printer App

7.  Verify that you have the latest version of the Stratus Printer App installed.
    
    1.  To see a list of available versions from GTP, run this command from a command prompt – i.e., type CMD into the Windows search bar, run that, then type in the following command:
        
        winget show GTPSoftware.Print -s GtpSoftware --versions
        
    2.  Compare this to the version of your Printer app.
        
8.  Verify that the Stratus Print application is open.
    
9.  Verify that the printer is not asleep.
    
10.  Verify the computer has a station assigned to it if attempting to print from a station.
    
11.  Read the LOG file generated by the Stratus Print app.
    
    1.  Exit the Stratus Print app first (so that it will flush its remaining log entries),
        
    2.  then go to  
        C:\\Users\\**<Windows User>**\\AppData\\Roaming\\GTP STRATUS Logs\\Print\\
        
    3.  See the Log.Txt file in that folder.
        
    4.  Open with notepad or some other tool.
        
        1.  Note well: The newest activity is at the bottom (the oldest log activity is at the top).
            
    5.  From top down, search for the word “Error” or “Warn”
        
12.  Check Windows User Rights:  You do **not** need to run the Stratus Printer app as an administrator, but IT department must not lock down the user profile's write rights to the %appdata% part of the hard drive. 
    
13.  Check Firewalls: The Workstation app uses SignalR over port 443, therefore your IT department has to allow websockets via your firewall.
    
14.  If you cannot print with a certain user, troubleshoot by trying to print with a user that has elevated rights on the machine and in Stratus.
    
15.  Try to print a label from a computer NOT connected to your network. If you don’t know how to do this, the GTP SD team can impersonate a user in your company and print to one of their ZPL printers. If they are able to print to a ZPL from Stratus via a user from your company, then there is likely a Windows policy on your computer that prevents the app (via that user) from printing.
    
16.  If you still have no success, send the log file from Step 1 above to the GTP Service Desk

## Troubleshooting

**Q:** What if I completed a part by mistake?

**A:** The welder can click **Repeat Weld** if the part is on top of the Completed List. If it’s not, they are  
required to Send the part to the tool again from Stratus website.

**Q:** I see an incorrect tracking status in Stratus  
**A:** Feel free to delete. It does not cause any problem to the SWR

**Q:** The currently selected part is incorrect. How can I select another part?  
**A:** The welder can use the **Skip Procedure** button to switch the part with another one from the  
Waiting List.

**Q:** What happens if I close the SWR?  
**A:** The loaded queue will be lost. The part needs to be resent from Stratus website

# PypeServer - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> A .PSVR file can be generated and exported from Stratus and imported into PypeServer.  PSVR works from the Package's Cut Lists tab where a separate cut list PSVR file is generated for each material-diameter combination. Configuration of PSVR output relies on Admin > Company > Pipe Cuts settings, where the company's o-let hole sizes, connector bevel angles, etc. are entered.  PSVR cut list files are sent to a station configured for the PypeServer tool. See the Pipe Cuts (Admin) article for more infomation. The Pipe Cuts page describes the best practice configuration for AutoCAD and Revit and the Pipe Cuts configuration within Stratus. Pipe Cuts configuration is needed because it is difficult for PypeServer to determine whether a connector needs to be a bevel or plain angle cut. The process of downloading PSVR cut list files happens in the Shops > Station view.

## Stratus / PypeServer .PSVR Output Workflow

A .PSVR file can be generated and exported from Stratus and imported into PypeServer.  PSVR works from the Package's Cut Lists tab where a separate cut list PSVR file is generated for each material-diameter combination. Configuration of PSVR output relies on Admin > Company > Pipe Cuts settings, where the company's o-let hole sizes, connector bevel angles, etc. are entered.  PSVR cut list files are sent to a station configured for the PypeServer tool. See the [**Pipe Cuts (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201490457 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201490457") article for more infomation. The Pipe Cuts page describes the best practice configuration for AutoCAD and Revit and the Pipe Cuts configuration within Stratus. Pipe Cuts configuration is needed because it is difficult for PypeServer to determine whether a connector needs to be a bevel or plain angle cut. The process of downloading PSVR cut list files happens in the Shops > Station view. See the [**Shops Dashboard**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8913014 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8913014") article for more information.

Note: PCF output also works with PypeServer, but will always be a manual file export and relies on setting managed on the PypeServer side.

Before a .PSVR file can be generated, configure a PypeServer tool under Admin > Company > Tools. See the [**Tools**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220225 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220225") article for more information. Below is an example. 

## Configure a Station

Before a .PSVR file can be generated, configure a Station that will run the cutting tool under Admin > Company > Stations. See the [**Stations**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220408 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220408") article for more information. Below is an example. 

## Configure Pipe Cuts

Configuration of PSVR output relies on Admin > Company > Pipe Cuts settings, where the company's o-let hole sizes, connector bevel angles, etc. are entered. See the [**Pipe Cuts**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201490457 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201490457") article for more information.

## Configure Cut List Mappings 

A Cut List Mappings for each Part Template must be configured to tell Stratus which data fields to use.

**To configure a Cut List Mapping:** 

1.  Got to Admin > Company > Part Templates. 
    
2.  In the Parts section, select or search for Part Template Name.  
    
    1.  **Hint**:  To determine a Part Template Name, in any Stratus viewer, open the Properties tool, select the part, and then locate the Template Name.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/69d273aa-77ed-402a-a957-67f44e16896e)
        
3.  **Select** the Part Template and then click the **Cut List Mappings** tab.   
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/29e6abcd-59ed-435a-a16c-e3f71b9ee03d)
    
4.  In the **Consider for Multi-Axis Cut Lists** section, select a part parameter from your database that contains the data for each field. The parameters that need to be selected will vary depending the type of part selected. 
    
    1.  **Straight Pipe** fields:  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/d5a57187-f622-4fe7-b3d9-3c50b46ce1e2)
        
    2.  **Saddle** fields:  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/5f646d28-bb46-4f69-9bcb-cf4443be65c1)
        
    3.  **Revit Family Content - Pipes Pipe Type (No Fabrication Content)**   
        **Create Project Parameters (Required)**  
        Stratus uses the Revit API to extract data from the model. Diameter and Pipe End Connector parameters must be defined in Revit as a project parameter so that the data can be injected into the part. The project parameter tells Stratus where to look for the parameter in your model.
        
        1.  Stratus uses the Inside and Outside Diameter.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/1ed6a4a4-bc27-454f-8a22-0ebebfa44c2a)
            
        2.  Companies need to map a project parameter to the Segment and Sizes.  
            
            ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/8968c198-f6a1-4165-960b-498fbe3ed03e)
            
    4.  **Revit Family Content – Shaped Nipple**   
        The Shaped Nipple is similar to the Pipes Pipe Type but an Olet Type also needs to be selected.  
        
        ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/326c6a5d-22fb-4717-aa57-8d169b738f2b)
        

## Generate a .PSVR output file

To generate a .PSVR file: 

1.  Open a package that includes straight pipe along with Connectors, Saddles, or Olets. 
    
2.  With the package open, click the **Cut Lists** tab.  
    
3.  To enable the **Generate Cut List** button, check that the package is set with a “**Can Cut List**” tracking status. See the [**Tracking Statuses (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761") article for more information.
    
4.  Click the **Generate Cut List** button.  
    
5.  The cut list will display.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/8192750c-bb84-4a6c-b2a0-4933b79092b5)
    
    1.  For each cut list row that will be sent to a PypeServer cutting machine, select the correct **Station.**  See the [**Station (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220408 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/215220408") article for more information.
        
    2.  Check the rows that will be sent to the station. 
        
    3.  Click the **Send Cut List to Station** button. 
        
    4.  Click **OK** on the Send Cut Lists dialog box.
        
6.  Cut List files are organized under the **Shops** tab.  
    
7.  On the Shops > Dashboard, select the **Shop.** A list of Stations for the Shop display.   
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/3b50ffc5-d440-41ae-962c-440c2f1ec4df)
    
8.  Click the **Station** name and a list of requested cut lists will display.
    
9.  Click the **Send to Tool** button associated with the Cut List. A PSVR file will be created for each material-diameter combination.    
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/3c89027d-cb16-43a5-8741-98bd340a9b0b)
    
10.  The .PSVR file will be a downloaded by your web browser.
    
11.  The Job Value in the .PSVR file with the Stratus Package Name.  
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/241eea9b-6b0c-447a-bfcb-ea938a1bacec)
    
    **How to use the .PSVR file**
    
12.  Locate the downloaded .PSVR file and save it to a location that can be used by the PypeServer software. 
    
13.  The CAD department loads the .PSVR file into the PypeServer software. 
    
14.  PypeServer’s powerful tools can be used to prepare the pipe to be cut. 
    
15.  Auto-nest the cut list and PypeServer will optimize nesting. 
    
16.  When ready to cut, Load to Machine and enter the Heat number. 
    
17.  The pipe staging tool instructs the operator to Align the torch centerline. 
    
18.  And when ready, the operator starts the cutting tool at the gantry. 
    

## Generate a .PSVR File after Using Spool Checker

When using Spool Checker under Assemblies > Assembly > Spool Checker Tool, modifications at either end of the pipe will be reconciled with relative dimensional references. For the initiated, lengths can be affected at either the C1 or C2 end. This means that length will be taken up or given on the correct end of the pipe depending on the locked part scenario you are dealing with in the Spool Checker. This delivers feature parity to ITM and Revit pipe for multi-axis pipe cut file generation.

You can see 2” being taken off of either end of what was originally a 60” part in the screenshots below:

# QR Code on CAMduct Label - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> Q:     How can I embed a Stratus QR Code on CAMduct labels.

---
> **Q:**     How can I embed a Stratus QR Code on CAMduct labels. 
> 
> **A:**     To print CAMduct labels with a Stratus QR code:
> 
> 1\. In Stratus under **Admin** > **Company** > **Settings**, enter a custom data field name for the **Property to Map to QR Code** setting under the Common to AutoCAD and Revit section (Ex. QR Code).  
> 
> ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/75076e48-caaf-442c-8083-46b2baba5364)
> 
> 2\. In Fabrication, add a custom data field, with the exact same spelling as the Stratus Property to Map to QR Code, under **Edit Main Database** > **Takeoff** > **Custom Data** (Ex. QR Code).  
> 
> ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/1b3d53d5-4d34-4c35-b648-2816e2561be0)
> 
> 3\. In CAMduct, under **File** > **Print Layout** > **Labels**, you can create a new label. In this example, click/drag the Item Custom Data Field onto your label.  
> 
> ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/3832c246-0689-47ca-8a04-485e758fd262)
> 
> 4\. In CAMduct, under Object Properties:
> 
> a. Set the **Data** to the name / index # for the Custom Data field created in Fabrication above (Ex. QR Code).  
> 
> ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/71912c5c-eecf-4809-a11c-11c833441e10)
> 
> ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/c2a2c3ba-e559-4280-85b8-3a53e61a3441)
> 
> 5\. A QR code example will display on the label.  
> 
> ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/ef907dfa-99f3-4f51-a955-0ba3d21571e0)
> 
>   
> 6\. Before you can preview the QR code, open a CADmep drawing that has been published to Stratus. Click the **Import** button on the GTP Stratus add-in to assign the Stratus Property to Map to QR Code to each part’s CADmep Custom Data field defined above.
> 
> 7\. Go to the CAMduct Print Preview and select the label.  A preview similar to the following will display. The QR Code is linked to Stratus. You can scan the QR code to update tracking status or view a Stratus landing page will display where you can view the part in the model.  
> 
> ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/ab8b4c35-4d38-4dde-b035-f8ac80b02aac)
> 
> **Q:**     How can I use the MAJ directly from Stratus? 
> 
> **A:**     The QR Code is written to the External  Link field on the Item at position 1 when the MAJ is generated. Using this requires setting up the Label in a slightly different way where the External Link field is used and set the Data Index to 1.
>

## Preliminaries

Before following these instructions, shut down RG3 and the Workstation App if it is already running on your RazorGage PC.

## Installing RG3

RG3 must be installed on the same PC as you install the Workstation APP.

**You should see this icon (don’t click it yet!)**

If you don’t have RG3 installed, please contact RazorGage to obtain an installer.

## Installing Stratus Workstation App

At the time of this writing, the Stratus interface with RazorGage is under development. For that reason, you will need to install the following experimental Workstation App. Install it on the same PC as your RG3 software.

## Option 1: Software Setup (Linking Workstation App to RG3)

This software has a 14 day Demo, then $135 per seat: [![](https://www.virtual-serial-port.org/favicon-16x16.png)Virtual COM Port Driver: create virtual COM ports in a system](https://www.virtual-serial-port.org/)

## Option 2: Hardware Setup (Linking Workstation App to RG3)

The RazorGage RG3 exposes a form of communication through COM ports which allows the Stratus Workstation App to communicate to RG3. For this reason, you should purchases a split serial cable and a null modem as follows:

A split serial cable with USB on one end, and two nine-pin serial interfaces, both male. Also, a Null Modem in the middle (both female).

You can buy this cabling from RazorGage, or get the null modem and similar split DB9 from these sources:

(these links last accessed 1/14/2024)

Connect the null modem as follows:

Plug the USB end into your PC (the same PC running RG3 and the Workstation App).

_\*\* DO NOT PLUG YOUR CABLE INTO YOUR PC YET \*\*_

When we plug the cable into your PC, it will get two COM ports assigned. We need to record those two number and use them. To do that, the following steps are provided.

With your new split cable NOT plugged in, run the device manager. Type device manager in your windows search bar:

Now click on “Device Manager” shown above, and the following program runs. When it opens, expand the Ports.

With this screen open, now you should plug in your new cable into a USB port. When you plug in the cable, you should see two new COM ports appear in your Device Manager:

In this case, COM4 and COM9 were created. This is important to note. We need to type these two numbers into our settings files.

## Assign a Port to RazorGage/RG3

To assign one of the two ports created above to RG3. There are two ways, one through RG3, and if that fails, we need to notepad and edit a setting file. Instructions for both methods follow.

Open RG3, click on Settings, enter the password (5239 in the default case), then go to the Remote Control tab, where you will be able to pick the COM4. Again, this is COM4 in our case, because COM4 is one of the ports added when we added our new cable – see above steps:

From here, you can select the COM port earlier found:

If the above steps did not work, then you can open Windows File explorer and go to:

**C:\\RG3\\Parameters**

From there, right-click on “MachineParameters.json” and edit with Notepad.

_**WARNING: Editing a JSON file must be done with great care.**_

In this file, change the RG3 COM port:

Save that file, and next let’s edit the settings file for the Workstation App.

## Assign a Port to Workstation App

We used COM4 for the RG3, so we will use COM9 for the Workstation App (your COM port numbers may differ, as per the above instructions).

If you have not installed the Workstation App yet, do that now. Once installed, do the following instructions.

Open File Explorer, and type %appdata% in the address bar and hit \[Enter\]

From here, go into “GTP Cloud - Workstation”

In this file, set ComPort to 9 and set the PusherType to 4

Save this, and now we are ready to Run the Workstation App and RG3!

## Ready to Run RG3 and Workstation App

Now start / restart RG3. With RG3 running, go to the RemotControl tab, and check that the COM port is open:

Now in the Windows Search, type Stratus and find the Stratus Workstation

To run the Workstation App, you will need a Stratus User/Password.

In the next screen shot (after logging in), you can click on Settings (bottom right of screen) and go to the General Tab.

Here you will pick a company and a tool. In Stratus, you need a Tool/Station that you can send cut-lists to. The Workstation App will read those, and show them. For more help on using the Workstation App, see the other GTP Knowledge Base articles.

## Pre-Steps: Purchasing a RazorGage (Two Kinds), and Licensing AutoList Single Cutlist mode

If you would like to purchase a RazorGage, there are two kinds. For this reason, _**please inform RazorGage that you want one to be used for integration with Stratus.**_ Also, you will need to purchase from RazorGage a license for the _Autolist Single Cutlist Mode Adder._ When you purchase the licensing for Single Cutlist mode, you will need to send them your RazorGage serial number (which is found in the title bar of your RGST software). If you would send an email to [steve.hoshor@tsiames.com](mailto:steve.hoshor@tsiames.com "mailto:steve.hoshor@tsiames.com") and give him your serial number, he will invoice you for approximately $600 for the upgrade license (one time fee). You should then receive a license key / number that you type into your RazorGage when you go into CutList or AutoList screen. On the AutoList screen, under Settings, go to CutList configure, and you should be prompted for the license key/number.

## Stratus Software Installation

The purpose of this page is to show you how to install and configure the STRATS to RazorGage bridge software.

As of Sept 2022, the Stratus to RazorGage bridge software (called StratusRazor) is compatible with the CutList Mappings in Stratus.  You can download and install the STRATSRazor software onto your RazorGage from this link: [https://update.gtp.one/razor/StratusRazorInstall.exe](https://update.gtp.one/razor/StratusRazorInstall.exe "https://update.gtp.one/razor/StratusRazorInstall.exe"). 

This installer is to be run on your RazorGage table/pc, and step-by-step instructions are given below. This install will create C:\\StratusRazor\\ on your RazorGage device, which will hold all the software needed for your RazorGage to communicate with Stratus. In addition to installing StratusRazor, you will need to contact RazorGage to enable Single CutList mode on your RazorGage (if you have not already done so).  

## Stratus Configuration and Custom Fields

Each cut list sent from Stratus to a RazorGage can have custom fields; these are generally fields to be printed on the RazorGage labels. Configuring the fields sent down to the RazorGage from Stratus requires some setup steps inside Stratus, as follows.

In Stratus, create a tool of the type “RazorGage” and create a station that points to that tool. As a side-note, earlier versions of the StratusRazor (the versions pre-Sept 2022), used a tool type "CutList".  In the example below, we have a RazorGage tool type set up as Copper Razor, with a tracking status of type "Cut":

This tool is then assigned to a station in Stratus:

With the tool assigned to a station, you can send cut lists to the physical RazorGage associated with that station. Before you do that, there are four more steps required (summarized here, but expanded below):

1\. Set the tracking status to the cut status you desire when pipes are cut (see [_Set the Cut Tracking Status_](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=1761968726#RazorGageRGSTandStratus-SettheCutTrackingStatus "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=1761968726#RazorGageRGSTandStratus-SettheCutTrackingStatus") below).

2\. Set the titles of each field for when Stratus data is sent down to the RazorGage [ConfigureSingle-AxisCutListFieldsSenttoRazorGage](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=SK&title=ConfigureSingle-AxisCutListFieldsSenttoRazorGage&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=1761968726 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=SK&title=ConfigureSingle-AxisCutListFieldsSenttoRazorGage&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=1761968726")

3\. You must run the association process of relating a tool in Stratus to a physical RazorGage in the shop (this is done when you run the StratusRazor installer – for which, see more below).

## [Set the Cut Tracking Status](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=SK&title=Set%20the%20Cut%20Tracking%20Status&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=1761968726 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=SK&title=Set%20the%20Cut%20Tracking%20Status&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=1761968726")

In the case of setting up a RazorGage tool, you now select the "Tracking Status when Done" in Stratus itself. This status is the tracking status that the RazorGage will use after cutting. This is a new feature (as of Sept 2022) where the tracking status is defined and maintained within Stratus proper. 

## [Configure Single-Axis Cut List Fields Sent to RazorGage](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=SK&title=Configure%20Single-Axis%20Cut%20List%20Fields%20Sent%20to%20RazorGage&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=1761968726 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/createpage.action?spaceKey=SK&title=Configure%20Single-Axis%20Cut%20List%20Fields%20Sent%20to%20RazorGage&linkCreation=true&fromPageId=1761968726")

With the new RazorGage tool type, you are able to send fields to the RazorGage from the Package CutList screen (in the same way as with the Workstation App and TigerStop). You configure which fields are sent to the RazorGage through the Stratus Company->Admin->Part Template -> Cut List Mapping. In the example below we are configuring the cu tlist template for pipes of type 2041. When Stratus creates cut lists for a tool, it can send custom fields appropriate to the type of labels you want to print while cutting.  Custom fields to send to the machine are set in the Cut List Mapping via UserData1, UserData2…UserData9 (as shown below):

This Cut List Mapping is for straight pipes (Part Number 2041), and it has three fixed fields – Material, Size, and Length -- and it has nine custom fields. These nine custom fields can be used for printer labels.

## Configuring RazorGage Printer Labels Based on Your Cut List Mappings

In the above screenshot, we created a cut list mapping for pipes of type 2041 (straight pipe), and the cut list mapping has been configured with nine custom fields for printing on labels relevant to that type of pipe. Notice that these custom fields are called "User Data 1"..."User Data 9". This is an important point because on the RazorGage, we need to know what those fields mean.  For example, UserData4 in the above example is the Reference Level. On the RazorGage printer label, you will want to see the label, "Reference Level" or "Level", not "User Data 4". To tell the RazorGage what each User Data field means, you have to configure your tool's Label Template. This is done under Admin->Company->Tools,

From here, you will press the \[Edit Label Template\] for the tool of interest (in our case, the COPPER RAZOR). Pressing this button brings up a dialog box where we can specify what each field means:

The RazorGage will receive these nine fields as “UserData1”…”UserData9”. However, we assigned them meaningful names, like LEVEL for UserData4, and that too will be passed down to the RazorGage for the print labels. It is worth noting that you do not have to type out UserData1=END TYPE, you could just type 1=END TYPE. That is, you could enter the data this way as well:

1=END TYPE  
2=SPOOL NAME  
3=SERVICE  
4=LEVEL  
5=AREA  
6=PACKAGE  
7=BimAbbrev  
8=AssemQR  
9=Adj Cut Len

You are also able to send down other data to the RazorGage, not included in the Cut List Mapping. For example, Message.LengthInFeetAndInches is a field available to you. In the above screen example, it is passed down as architectural length for the print label. 

### **Decimal Places**

In the example above, there were nine fields in the Tools, "Label Template", and the ninth one was Adjusted Cut Length.

              9=Adj Cut Len

If you want to change the number of decimal places used for the Adj Cut Len, you can use this nomenclature:

              9.3=Adj Cut Len

This means that the ninth UserData slot in the Part Template cutlist mapping (in Stratus) will be written to the RazorGage DB with only 3 digits of decimal precision.

### **Length Decimal Limits in RGST**

There is a known bug in the Razor Gage software where the length field (on a pipe being cut), must not be more than three decimal places (sometimes shows in Razor Gage as "Error 3021"). To make sure that Stratus does not write more that three decimal places to this field, you can configure a custom length field (inches) under your part template mapping that is limited to three decimal places, or you can add the following "Fields" JSON to your Tools, Label Template:

{"Fields": \[ {"StratusName": "","Display": "LENGTH", "decimals": 3 }\]}

_**IMPORTANT: Make sure this line at the end (is the last part of your label template).**_

Or, as in the screen shot here:

### **Overriding Blank Values**

When you send down parts to be cut (send them down from Stratus to the RazorGage), and if a part is in an assembly/spool, then the assembly name for the part will be blank. If you want to print the word "Unassembled" for the assembly name (instead of printing a blank), you would add the following to your Label Template:

       \_\_unassembled=Unassembled

This says that any part that is not part of an assembly has an assembly name "Unassembled". 

Alternatively, you could specify a default value for a blank field using the pipe command:

        2=SPOOL NAME | Not Assembled

In this case, the default value for when the 2nd field is blank, is "Not Assembled".

### **Putting it all together**

The order of how you put the above fields together MATTERS. Make sure you put the {} data last!

1=QR Code  
2=Spool  
3=Job  
4=Pipe Length  
5=Bim Area  
6=Package  
7=Imperial16ths  
8=Product  
9=mSize

\_\_unassembled=Unassembled

{"Fields": \[ {"StratusName": "","Display": "LENGTH", "decimals": 3 }\]}

As noted above, StratusRazor is the bridge program that binds Stratus to the RazorGage. It can be installed from here: [https://update.gtp.one/razor/StratusRazorInstall.exe](https://update.gtp.one/razor/StratusRazorInstall.exe "https://update.gtp.one/razor/StratusRazorInstall.exe").  This program is to be run on the RazorGage tablet/pc.

When you run the installer, you will be prompted to log into Stratus so that it can associate your RazorGage with your Stratus company. You may consider this as a kind of pairing operation. The association program will find any tools in your organization that are type RazorGage, and let you associate one of them to the RazorGage on which you ran the program. Simply select the tool of your choice, and click the \[ Associate \] button. After that, close the program and the installation will be complete. 

Note well: Division and CostCode are optional. If set, then each cut tracking status gets these values associated with it.

## Install Technical Details

StratusRazor always gets installed to the same location on all devices:

                C:\\StratusRazor\\

This same lining program can be run at any time after the installation if you want to re-associate the tool with a different device name. To run it again, go to

                 C:\\StratusRazor\\link\\AssociateDevice.exe

## RazorGage Install and Operation

A version of the Razor Gage software capable of single-axis cutlist is available from the following link (though you may want to contact RazorGage for the most up-to-date version):

             [_https://razorgage.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/RGST\_v7.16.08\_Demo\_Install.zip_](https://razorgage.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/RGST_v7.16.08_Demo_Install.zip "https://razorgage.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/RGST_v7.16.08_Demo_Install.zip")

This software requires special licensing for use with Stratus, the _Autolist Single Cutlist Mode Adder_ (see below).

Note well: the above software is different than the Stratus-to-RazorGage software that lives on the Stratus help page (accessed from Stratus by clicking on the ![Question Mark](https://pf-emoji-service--cdn.us-east-1.prod.public.atl-paas.net/atlassian/productivityEmojis/question-32px.png) next to your badge).

## Razor Licenses

After installing, you must obtain the RazorGage software and license for _Autolist Single Cutlist Mode Adder_ (contact RazorGage to get tis license – send them your RazorGage serial number).

To get the print labels on the RazorGage to have more meaningful names for each of the fields, you must edit the Label Template for the tool as described above.

## RazorGage AutoList and Single-Axis CutList mode

If you don’t see the AutList Screen, you need to contact RazorGage for licensing – you will need to purchase the _Autolist Single Cutlist Mode Adder_ from RazorGage.

Clicking on \[AutoList Screen\] takes you to the cutlist mode screen

From here, Clicking on \[Settings\] and then \[Single CutList Mode\] takes you to the setup screen for single-axis cut lists. 

## Finding the StratusRazor Version

You likely will not need to know the version number of the StratusRazor bridge software, but it can be found in two places.

The first place to find the StratusRazor version is in your tracking logs on cut parts. The StratusRazor version is logged in the comments with each tracking status change.

The version can also be found by running:      

                   C:\\StratusRazor\\StratusFieldSelector.exe

and clicking on the Update tab.

## Tracking Status – Optional Speed Optimization Feature Scheduled Task

Normally, when you cut a part with the razor gage, the tracking status is sent immediately to Stratus to indicate completion. RazorGage itself is configured to send the status after every part is cut, and this is found under the Single Cutlist Mode Settings (which you reach by clicking on the \[ Settings \] button:

From here, click on the Single Cutlist Mode button:

The Single Cutlist Mode screen is where you configure the frequency of the RazorGage sending tracking status back to Stratus. The default is 1 (1 part). That is, after each part is cut, RazorGage will call back to Stratus a second time (which adds a noticeable overhead of one to six seconds). To erase this overhead, there is a task scheduled event that is installed which allows you to configure RazorGage to not report back so often.

When the StratusRazor installs, it creates a scheduled task that will keep your RazorGage tracking status in sync with Stratus on a 5-minute timer.  Because that is happening, it means you are able to increase the frequency of when RazorGage reports back tracking status changes. In the screen below (reached by the steps listed above), we have the frequency set to 1000 (the Runs/Parts value shown below). That is, RazorGage will only report back tracking status changes after every 1000 cuts – which isn't a problem, since the scheduled task is reporting back the changes on a five-minute scheduled task frequency). 

If for some reason, you don't want the Stratus reporting back on a five-minute schedule, you can leave the setting in RazorGage to 1 for the Runs/Parts setting. You can also deleted the scheduled task associated with the RazorGage under the windows task scheduler. If for some reason you are having problems with tracking statuses being transmitted back to Stratus, the following section may help you find and solve any problems.

## Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting Razor Gage "Syntax error (missing operator)"

If you get the following screen, or one like it, it means that in RazorGage, you are grouping by a field that has feet/inch values in it. This is a problem inside the actual RazorGage software, as the same character that means feet (the ' symbol), is also used by the underlying SQL of RazorGage to quote values in fields. To fix this, change your sorting/grouping choices in RazorGage.

## Troubleshooting Razor Gage Error 3021

In the event that you get the following error, please follow the instructions above: [**Length Decimal Limits in RGST**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1761968726/RazorGage+RGST#RazorGage-LengthDecimalLimitsinRGST "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1761968726/RazorGage+RGST#RazorGage-LengthDecimalLimitsinRGST")

## Troubleshooting Tracking Status Issues

After the RazorGage cuts material, it updates its own internal database with a cut status for the cut part, then at a later time, that cut status is transmitted back to Stratus in one of two ways: 1. asynchronously (i.e., in the background) via a scheduled task event (the default behavior), or 2. synchronously as described in the section just above this section. 

You will be able to determine if you have Tracking Statuses in your local RazorGage waiting to be transmitted to Stratus by running 

                   C:\\StratusRazor\\StratusFieldSelector.exe

And from there, selecting the following option and pressing **\[Run\]**

If, after running that, you see a list of parts that are cut, but which have not had their cut status sent to Stratus, then it may be necessary to validate that your Task Scheduler is working properly (the program used to send back tracking statuses). To do that, launch Task Scheduler:

After Task Scheduler launches, locate the GTP RAZOR SYNC entry:

Next, right click on that and go to properties, and make sure the user is a valid user on your system to run task schedule event. 

If your tracking statuses are not flowing to Stratus, try changing the user to "SYSTEM":

### Forcing the Tracking Statuses to be uploaded to Stratus

In addition to the above steps, you should then force your RazorGage to be in sync with Stratus via the following two commands:

RazorGage has and uses its own database (a database that Stratus interacts with). Stratus has provided a tool that gives the user limited access to that database for diagnostic purposes. Namely, you are able to inspect the already-cut parts that have been sent down to the RazorGage, delete already-cut parts out of the database, etc. The name of this tool is _**StratusFieldSelector.exe.**_

## Finding and Running _**StratusFieldSelector.exe**_

When you install the StratusRazor software onto your machine, you will have the following directory 

           C:\\StratusRazor\\

In that directory, there is a program called _**StratusFieldSelector.exe**_ which is a Support Tool for debugging problems with the Stratus Razor integration (notice the one in green is the actual executable):

Running that brings up this screen (the version number may be different):

This program has tabs along the top where you can select areas of functionality. Not all the tabs are fully implemented, and this documentation only deals with sections of the program commonly used for debugging problems on the Razor Gage.

## Using Run Commands 

From here, make a selection and press the 

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/04a76b70-b98c-496a-bdca-9034b0ea693e)

button. 

### Manipulating the RazorGage Database 

The Razor Gage software (produced by the Razor Gage company) uses a Microsoft Access database. Sometimes, that database can become large or corrupt, and one way to manipulate it is through the _**StratusFieldSelector.exe**_. With this program you can go to the Run Commands tab:

If you have Read Only checked, no changes will be made to the database.

#### Removing already cut parts from your RazorGage

If you find that your RazorGage database is backing up with cut parts, and not emptying itself, then Stratus has provided the ability to empty the database. To do that, run the following:

#### Erasing ALL parts in the DB

If for some reason, your database gets in a state that you can't seem to sync with Stratus, an option you can do is wipe out all the parts in the RazorGage database by selecting, "Erase All Parts in DB" then Run.

## **Printing Labels**

RGST prints to the default printer on your system. Make sure your ZPL is your default printer.

Sometimes if you install your ZPL printer directly from Windows, it won't work. If this is your situation (the ZPL won't print), consider the following steps:

1.  Install the ZPL Setup Utility [https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/printer-software/printer-setup-utilities.html](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/printer-software/printer-setup-utilities.html "https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/printer-software/printer-setup-utilities.html")
    
2.  Install your ZPL printer drives from the Zebra Setup Utility
    
3.  RazorGage software RGST prints to your default printer. For this reason, in Windows under Printers, set your ZPL printer as the default printer.
    

## **Optional: Cutting Unistrut, Pipe and Rod on the same RazorGage. Also, Overcoming Printing Limitations**

Razor Gage prints labels through their software. Stratus does not have direct control of printing. Inside Stratus, in Company->Admin-Tools, the Label Template for a RazorGage tool is NOT a printer label (per se), but rather just a list of fields + names mappings (the list of fields + names corresponds to the cutlist mapping, user defined fields). The values for these fields get sent down from Stratus to the RazorGage with each cutlist. The reason this is noteworthy, is if you send a Unitstrut to a particular RazorGage, and then a pipe cutlist to the same Razor Gage, then the same mapping information in the Label Template is used for both, but the content of the values for those fields won't necessarily match. This may sound confusing, and it would only be a concern if you are cutting Rods, Unitstrut and Pipe all on the same RazorGage.

To help solve this problem, we have a RazorSwap / Database Switcher that runs on the RazorGage, which lets you set up your RazorGage for these three scenarios (Unistrut, Rod, Pipe).

 You can download that software here: 

[https://github.com/srives/RazorSwap/releases/download/3.0/RazorSwap.exe](https://github.com/srives/RazorSwap/releases/download/3.0/RazorSwap.exe "https://github.com/srives/RazorSwap/releases/download/3.0/RazorSwap.exe")

The program (when installed) is a desktop icon called RazorSwap.

When you run on that, you will see this screen:

By selecting one of the three options, you can press SWAP and then RazorGage will be launched. This will allow you the ability to set your RazorGage labels for that kind of cutting.

The workflow would be:

1.  On the RazorGage: Run the RazorSwap
    
2.  On the RazorGage: Select the kind of cutting you want to do (Unitstrut, Rod or Pipe), and press SWAP.
    
3.  In Stratus, send a cutlist down for what you selected in step 2 above. Do NOT send pipes down to be cut when you are running in Rod or Unistrut mode.
    
4.  Configure your print labels according to the names of the columns in the cutlist (note well, the names may seem completely unrelated to the content they hold)
    

Each time you want to switch and cut a different kind of object, repeat the steps above. 

**WHY?** The reason this solution is like this is that we (Stratus) do NOT send down ZPL printer labels to the RazorGage. The RazorGage prints its labels, so we had to set up different RazorGage databases for each kind of object to be cut. We are working around how RazorGage works. And you can think of this as having THREE virtual RazorGage devices on one physical RazorGage (Unistrut, Rod and Pipe). Each kind of object gets its own cutlist database and print labels.

>         
> 8.  When CSV or Excel export buttons are clicked, only the visible columns will be exported.
>     

## How can I sort data by column?

> **A:**     When a column can be used to sort the data in a table, the up/down arrow icon will display. Click the icon to sort the table.  
>  
> 
> ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/4d01376f-bda9-4635-8cea-99532ff36e4e)
> 
> 1.  **Click 1** - sorts the column in ascending order.  
>     
>     ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/8f5fc955-086c-4906-9245-f33a55b82fde)
>     
> 2.  **Click 2** - sorts the column in descending order.  
>     
>     ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/c849cd01-043a-4a3a-bec6-7d047158bdf4)
>     
> 3.  **Click 3** - sets the table back to the default sort order according to either the pre-defined table sort order (if one exists) or the sort order specified by the report’s sort index settings.  
>     
>     ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/01b04683-8c0b-4299-b4df-1714ec344f9e)
>     
> 4.  Another way to sets the table back to the default sort order is to click the **Reset sorting** button.
>     

## How does the Sort Index under Admin > Company > Report > Report Fields impact the sort order of a data table?

**A:** Report designers can specify a Sort Index for custom reports under Admin > Company > Reports > Report Fields. When a custom report is first loaded by a user, the Sort Index with the lowest number will be the primary sort. The next lowest index number will be a secondary sort when the primary sort includes identical values. Ex. If the table displays states, cities, and zip codes where state is sort index 1, city is sort index 2, and zip code is sort index 3, then, the primary sort will be state, the secondary sort will be cities which will be sorted alphabetically, and zip codes will be the third sort when there is more than one city.

**Note**: After a user manually changes the sort order for a dashboard, that sort order will override the default sort order and will continue to be the primary sort on that table for that user until the user changes it. The lowest sort index will become the secondary sort, and so on.

## Do some reports have a default sort order?

> **A:** Default reports for the following dashboards include a default sort order. After a user manually changes the sort order for a dashboard, that sort order will override the default sort order and will continue to be the primary sort on that table for that user until the user changes it.
> 
> -   **Packages Dashboard** \- Required date
>     
> -   **Assemblies Dashboard** - Assembly Name
>     
> -   **Container Dashboard**
>     
>     -   **Report** \- Container Type
>         
>     -   **Details Report** - Item Type
>         

## How does the column filter work?

> **A:**  When a column can be used to filter the data in a table, the filter icon will display.
> 
> 1.  When the column is not being filtered, the Filter icon is filled white.
>     
> 2.  Click the filter icon. The Filter icon is filled with black and the Filters drop-down button will display.
>     
> 3.  Click the Filters drop-down arrow to display the list of filter values.
>     
>     1.  The Search text box, **Select All**, and **Deselect All** and **Close** buttons will display.
>         
>     2.  The drop-down list will remain expanded so that multiple drop-down options can be selected or deselected.

>         ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/43e2034b-e86a-49c6-8dbd-197e1a9d96f2)
>         
>         1.  The selected item(s) will:
>             
>             1.  Display in their own alphabetically sorted list at the top of the drop-down.
>                 
>             2.  Each selected item will be **highlighted blue** and include an **x** which can be used to removed the option.
>                 
>             3.  The data table will be filtered to the selected items.
>                 
>     4.  To de-select an item and remove it from the selected list, either:
>         
>         1.  Click the option’s **x** (Ex. Packaged).
>             
>         2.  Click the **blue highlighted row**.  
>             
>             ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/bb1799f4-9947-4e05-b8cb-e6e950254ed0)
>             
>         3.  The de-selected option (Ex. Packaged) returns to it’s place in the non-selected option list.
>

## Best Practices

API usage is actively monitored for excessive errors and/or API abuse. Here are a few tips to becoming a "good citizen":

-   Avoid high frequency polling. Polling too often can overwhelm our servers.
    
-   Consider taking advantage of "include" and/or "where" filters to reduce payload sizes.
    
-   Handle exceptions to reduce server load. Consider retry logic but set a retry limit after 3 failures. If exceptions continue, contact support, don't keep hammering the API.
    
    -   We recommend using: [GitHub - App-vNext/Polly: Polly is a .NET resilience and transient-fault-handling library that allows developers to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner. From version 6.0.1, Polly targets .NET Standard 1.1 and 2.0+.](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly "https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly")
        
-   Some of API's have throttle limits. If this scenario is encountered, the API will return a 429 (too many requests) response code along with an expiration in seconds. Customer code should be able to handle this expiration accordingly and wait before retrying.
    
-   When paging, handle page size changes dynamically. From time-to-time (not often), we change page size limits to conserve load on our servers. Your code should be able to flex dynamically to handle these scenarios.
    
    -   To improve performance, and you don't need the 'total' property, consider using the 'disabletotal' query arg.
        
    -   AVOID PARALLEL PROCESSING.

## Power BI Connected to the Stratus Open API

## Summary

A Power BI report can be directly connected to the Stratus Open API utilizing company queries available to all customers without requiring custom programming. In a few places, users will need to fill in the unique company id or app key, but this is feasible for all customers.  

In this example, complete instructions are provided to build the Power BI report **Total Feet by Completed Date** from scratch to show cut lists processed in the last year, broken down by material, size and station.  The report will get data directly from Stratus via the Open API using predefined company queries available to all Stratus customers. Alternatively to building the report from scratch, users can download the finished report file (.pbix) and then consult the step-by-step instructions to tweak the report. See the [**Use Existing Report Steps**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1829077164/STRATUS+API#STRATUSAPI-UseExistingReportSteps "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/1829077164/STRATUS+API#STRATUSAPI-UseExistingReportSteps") for more information.

Below is an example of the final report.

## Prerequisites

-   Create a Stratus App Key via Stratus > Admin > Company > App Keys
    
-   Install Power BI Desktop to author the Power BI report file
    
-   Configure a Power BI Workspace to publish reports to the cloud for sharing
    
-   Purchase Power BI Pro licenses for Microsoft Office 365 user accounts in order to share Power BI report results via Microsoft Teams
    

## Use Existing Report Steps

The following steps can be used to build the Power BI Report **Total Feet by Completed Date** using an existing file created by Jonathan at GTP.

1.  Download the [**Stratus Cut List Power BI report .pbix file**](https://gogtp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSharedFiles/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?FolderCTID=0x01200081B9632F7281AA4289CFC6C8F48E9758&id=%2Fsites%2FCustomerSharedFiles%2FShared%20Documents%2FGTP%20STRATUS%2FFile%20Share%20to%20Customers%2FPower%20BI%2FStratusCutLists%2Epbix&parent=%2Fsites%2FCustomerSharedFiles%2FShared%20Documents%2FGTP%20STRATUS%2FFile%20Share%20to%20Customers%2FPower%20BI "https://gogtp.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerSharedFiles/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?FolderCTID=0x01200081B9632F7281AA4289CFC6C8F48E9758&id=%2Fsites%2FCustomerSharedFiles%2FShared%20Documents%2FGTP%20STRATUS%2FFile%20Share%20to%20Customers%2FPower%20BI%2FStratusCutLists%2Epbix&parent=%2Fsites%2FCustomerSharedFiles%2FShared%20Documents%2FGTP%20STRATUS%2FFile%20Share%20to%20Customers%2FPower%20BI").
    
2.  Open the file. You will get some warnings about credentials.  Modify each of the three queries to fill in your unique App Key and Company ID and then it will run for you.   
    Here’s how:
    
    1.  From the Data panel at the far right, click the … menu for Cut Lists and choose the ‘Edit query’ option.  This will open Power Query Editor.
        
    2.  In Power Query Editor, click the first ‘Source’ entry in the APPLIED STEPS list on the right.
        
    3.  Then, click the little down arrow to expand the text edit window, so you can see the entire query with placeholders for FILL-IN-COMPANY-ID and FILL-IN-APP-KEY.
        
    4.  You need to replace these for each of the three queries.  You click click through each of them on the left side by selecting Cut Lists, Stations, and Tools.
        
    5.  Once you’ve updated each, click the disk save button, close out of the editor and choose to Apply your changes to the report.
        
3.  If you complete these steps and save the report, you will end up in the same place as running through the entire tutorial document below.
    
4.  Please submit a [**Stratus Service Desk**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3") request if you need to know your Company Id.
    

## Steps to Create the Report from Scratch

### Create Power BI Report and Get Data

1.  Open Power BI Desktop
    

3.  Click “Connect”
    
4.  Choose “Advanced” and fill in the URL parts as: [https://api.gtpStratus.com/v1/company/run-query?queryId=1c578a52-9145-4b42-8fb3-fcdca971be14&companyId=](https://api.gtpstratus.com/v1/company/run-query?queryId=1c578a52-9145-4b42-8fb3-fcdca971be14&companyId= "https://api.gtpstratus.com/v1/company/run-query?queryId=1c578a52-9145-4b42-8fb3-fcdca971be14&companyId=")**FILL-IN-COMPANY-ID**
    
    1.  Set the command timeout to a reasonable value like 5 minutes.
        
    2.  Enter app-key as a header parameter and fill in your app key id value from [https://www.gtpStratus.com/companyadmin#tab\_company-appkeys](https://www.gtpstratus.com/companyadmin#tab_company-appkeys "https://www.gtpstratus.com/companyadmin#tab_company-appkeys")
        
    3.  **NOTE**:  Partner App should be empty for App Keys used here. 
        
    4.  **NOTE**: email me to request your company id (it is temporary, as we plan to remove the argument since it is redundant and provided by the app-key)
        
    5.  **NOTE**: the queryId value 1c578a52-9145-4b42-8fb3-fcdca971be14 corresponds to the Admin Company Query named **Cut Lists In Last Year**  
        You can locate the queryId value for each available query in this way…
        
        1.  Open [https://www.gtpStratus.com/companyadmin#tab\_queries](https://www.gtpstratus.com/companyadmin#tab_queries "https://www.gtpstratus.com/companyadmin#tab_queries")
            
        2.  Press F12 to open the developer tools in the web browser
            
        3.  Click on the **Network** tab and then reload the webpage
            
        4.  Within the Network tab, search the Name column for get-queries and select it, then click the **Response** tab, and finally the pretty print **{ }** button
            
    6.  After clicking OK on the dialog and the web request succeeds, this query editor will display with the raw results.
        

### Transform Query results into Data

1.  Rename the Query in the right side Query Settings under Properties Name:
    
2.  Notice the APPLIED STEPS in the same panel, these are a series of sequential steps that transform the query results into a usable data table, so we need to add steps to cleanup the results
    
    1.  Click Split Column by Delimiter, so we can break the content into multiple rows at each carriage return
        
    2.  So it now looks like this:
        
    3.  Then we need to get rid of extra blank characters at the beginning and end of each line, so right click on the content column heading and choose the Transform Trim option as shown here:
        
    
    5.  Now, if you scroll to the very bottom of the list, you’ll see a blank row which needs to be removed, so click the toolbar button “Remove Rows” which flies out and choose the “Remove Bottom Rows” option, enter 1 and click OK
        
    6.  Now we’re ready to split each row into columns, using the Split Column by Delimeter again, but with different options specified:
        
    7.  Resulting in something like this:
        
    8.  Which is starting to look better.
        
    9.  Now we need to make the first row be the column headings, by clicking the “Use First Row as Headers” button:
        
    10.  Let’s review each column and make any changes to data types per column.  For example, I don’t care about the actual time, only the date for each entry, so I’m going to change the format of the CreatedDT column by right clicking the heading and choosing Change Type to Date.  If it prompts you, choose “Add new step” for the conversion.
        
    11.  Next, I scrolled over and noticed the last few columns have data that looks all messed up and has some null values, like this:
        
    12.  And I realize looking back at the Name column, we have some comma separators in there, so the general rule of splitting the column at all instances of commas didn’t work right… so I’m going to take a step back and rework that step… which I can do by clicking the second “Split Column by Delimiter” in the APPLIED STEPS sequence:
        
    13.  After clicking it, only the steps to that point are applied to the output table results and we can right click the Split Column step and choose “Edit Settings”, where instead of using the “Each occurrence of the delimiter” option, let’s change to the “Right-most delimiter” and see what that does, click OK
        
    14.  I see it pulled off only one column at the right, but the values look good now, so let’s do the same again, click Split Column by Delimiter and lets add another of the same, splitting off one column from the right at a time
        
    15.  You will see this dialog, which is fine, click Insert
        
    16.  Choose Comma at Right-most delimiter again and click OK
        
    17.  Repeat this, splitting one right-most column at a time until you get all the columns created
        
    18.  You may need to split left-most column if there’s a column that includes commas in the values
        
    19.  Once you have each column separated and the data looks good, you can click to the next step in the APPLIED STEPS and if you get one that no longer works, just delete it, like this, clicking the little X icon on the step and then confirming Delete it
        
    20.  Finally, after clicking through the sequence of the APPLIED STEPS, if you can click down to the last one and all the data looks good, you are done!
        
    21.  (Note: I found I also needed to convert the last CompletedDT column to Date-Time and then another step to Date only)
        
    22.  You have transformed the data into something now usable in Power BI.
        
    23.  Click the little Save button in the upper left of the Power Query Editor
        
    24.  And then choose “Apply” in the dialog.
        
    25.  Then you can click the X in the upper right corner and you may be prompted again, choose Yes to apply.
        
    26.  You should land back in the Power BI Desktop report editor and see your “Cut Lists” on the Data panel.
        

### Add Stations and Tools

1.  Repeat the previous step, but this time choosing the **Stations** query id.
    
2.  Repeat the previous step with the **Tools** query id.
    
3.  Resulting in 3 Queries now and 3 sets of Data:
    

### Link data tables together by Id

1.  Click the **Model view** button
    
2.  Now we need to relate the cut list’s StationId to the Station’s Id and the Station’s ToolId to the Tool’s Id, to link the data together
    
3.  Before completing this, your expanded model view will look like this:
    
4.  So let’s link the properties together now…
    
5.  Click “StationId” in the Cut Lists model, then click and drag it over and drop onto the Station’s Id property.
    
6.  Then do the same for the tool relationship by selecting Station’s ToolId property and then clicking and dragging it over and dropping it on the Tool’s Id property.
    
7.  Once these relationships are created, the model view will look like this:
    
8.  Showing there is a 1 to many relationship… meaning 1 station may have many cut lists.
    
9.  Building these relationships allows the report to understand the links between the data returned from Stratus API calls.
    

### Add By Material Data Table

1.  Now we can click back to the Report view.
    
2.  Notice we have “Page 1” as our only tab at the bottom.  We can create a report with multiple pages, but for now, let’s just rename this page to “Cut Lists” by right clicking on the the Page 1 tab and choose rename, then type in the new name and press enter.
    
3.  It’s time to add our first visual! Let’s click to add a Matrix to the report view
    
4.  After clicking, the matrix will appear on the left and we can move and resize it as we like
    
5.  Now, we are ready to wire it up to some data!
    
6.  With the matrix visual selected, expand the Data sets in the far right Data bar and let’s select the Cut Lists : Material property and drag it onto the Visualizations Rows specification, where it says “Add data fields here”.
    
7.  Then do the same with Cut Lists : Size property… so you’ll have Material then Size for the Rows, like this:
    
8.  On the left in the matrix, you’ll now see something like this, where you can click to expand a material and see sizes:
    
9.  Next we want to add columns for number of items cut and total length, so we will drag and drop those two properties into the “Values” section in the Visualizations panel, like this:
    
10.  But this doesn’t look right… it thinks the items and total length values are text, not numeric values… so we need to go change the data type for each of these, so we can get a sum of their values.
    
11.  So click over to the “Data view”
    
12.  Then select the Cut Lists : Items column heading and then from the ribbon menu in “Column tools” at the top, change “Data type” from Text to “Whole number” and accept the message box that comes up.
    
13.  While in here, let’s change the “Completed” column data type to “True/false” and the TotalLengthInInches column data type to “Decimal number”
    
14.  In the case of the TotalLengthInInches column, we can also change the Format to Decimal number with 2 decimal places, instead of Auto
    
15.  So now switch back to the report view, remove the existing Items and TotalLength properties from the “Values” section and then add them back again. Should look like this now:
    
16.  Notice they say “Sum of Items” and “Sum of TotalLength”, which indicates they are recognized as numeric values.
    
17.  Also notice in the data matrix view, they appear to be formatted and provide a Total at the bottom of the data table
    
18.  I decided I also want to know how many cut lists of each material and size were processed, so to get this is kind of a trick… drag the Cut Lists : Id property into the first position in the Values section and then right click on the new entry and choose “Count (Distinct)”
    
19.  Now I want to change the column headings for each of these value columns. This is easily accomplished by right clicking on each of the items in the Values section and then choosing to “Rename for this visual” and then after renaming each, we have:
    
20.  I really would prefer Total Feet… so I need to add a new calculated column now. Click the … menu to the right of the Cut Lists entry in the Data panel and then click “New column”
    
21.  This will start a formula expression above the report, change it to match this…
    
22.  And then drag and drop the new TotalLengthInFeet property into the Values section and rename it to just “Total Feet” to look something like this now:
    
23.  And then you can remove the Total Inches column by pressing the little X next to it
    

### Add By Station Data Table

1.  Now I want to see the number of cut lists each station has processed, so let’s add a plain Table to the report. Start by clicking in white space to deselect the existing Matrix.  Then click the Table visual to add one to the report.
    
2.  Now, the first column to add is the Stations : Name, so with the Table highlighted, locate and click the Stations Data set and click the Name property to add it as a new column.
    
3.  The result will look something like this:
    
4.  Next, we want a count of Cut Lists for each Station, so we need to use the same trick from earlier and choose the Cut Lists : Id property and then use the Count (Distinct) option to get this:
    
5.  Now we can rename it from Count of Id to Cut Lists
    

### Add Graph!

1.  I’d really like to see a plot of total feet cut by date. So let’s deselect everything in the report by clicking in white space again.  Then click to add a “Line Chart” visual.
    
2.  Assign the Cut Lists : CompletedDT to the X-axis, but we need to change it from a Date Hierarchy to just a regular date, like this:
    
3.  Then drag the Cut Lists : TotalLengthInFeet property into the Y-axis, making sure it is configured as Sum, but rename it to just “Total Feet”
    
4.  Also rename CompletedDT to “Completed Date”
    
5.  My data is from a test database and is not great, but I think I got the graph setup correctly
    
6.  One of the really cool interactive features of Power BI is how it natively understands selections as filters. For example, when I click on Carbon Steel in the Materials list, it immediately filters the Stations and completed date graph down to just Carbon Steel content, like so:
    
7.  Save your report as a \*.pbix file.
    

### Publish (optional)

1.  If you have configured a Power BI workspace online, then you can publish your report (pbix file) by clicking the File menu and then Publish, and then Publish to Power BI
    

### Configure Data Refresh (optional)

1.  Once published, you can go to the Workspace at [app.powerbi.com](http://app.powerbi.com/ "http://app.powerbi.com") and choose Data hub
    
2.  Then click on the Dataset that corresponds to your new Cut Lists report
    
3.  Once selected, choose the Refresh drop down and “Schedule refresh”
    
4.  From there, you can scroll down to “Scheduled refresh” and update the refresh frequency.
    

### Add to Teams (optional)

1.  In Microsoft Teams, from within any Team, at the top of the page click the + button to add a new tab to the view. From the “Add a tab” dialog, search for and select “Power BI”
    
2.  From the Power BI dialog, browse your Workspaces to choose the report and then modify the “Tab name” below and click Save.
    
3.  The Power BI report results will be updated and displayed for any Team user who has access to the Workspace and also a Power BI Pro license to view reports.

## 23 June 2025 - 7.6.10.46

**Installers:**

-   **Stratus Addin** - None
    
-   **Stratus Workstation** - None
    

update Updated the loading process for the Assemblies Dashboard to better handle scenarios involving hundreds of thousands of assemblies, improving performance and responsiveness during large-scale data loads.

Fixed Fixed an issue where parts in the viewer were filtered but a resulting report included parts outside of the filter.

## 19 June 2025 - 7.6.10.45

**Installers:**

-   **Stratus Addin** - Optional
    
    -   Updated the publish process related to the Specific to Revit > Publish Conduit Assemblies (Custom Mark) setting. Conduit assemblies created in Revit will no longer duplicate when publishing to Stratus, even if the assembly name is changed.
        
-   **Stratus Workstation** - Optional
    
    -   Added support for metric display units.
        
    -   Fixed a cut list scrolling issue.
        

ADDED Added to Stratus Workstation support for metric display units (mm, cm, m). POS/Position and Remaining fields use units configured on the physical TigerStop machine. Under Settings, set the **Cut Length Display Units** and the Length values will displaying accordingly. **Note:** For the Material and Size tab, the 6” value shown in the screenshot will display in metric units if the Revit parts were configured in metric.

update All duct weight properties have been updated to report per item quantity. Material Weight and Weight have been changed to multiply out the rated weight by the centerline length. Duct Weight has been added. If you have your Cost Units set to Per Item Qty on your fittings, the value that you will see after your next publish will potentially be larger than was previously reported. These properties were previously only multiplying weight per ft on straights but are now reporting correctly!

-   A new “Duct Weight” property has been added from the Fabrication database.
    
-   The available weight properties for duct in Stratus are as follows:
    
    -   Duct Weight (Part development weight including conn/seam allowances)
        
    -   Material Weight (Same as Duct Weight but this includes wastage % from the costing database)
        
    -   Weight (Same as Material Weight but also includes including ancillary weight)
        

Example report out of CAD

Example report our of Stratus

update Updated the Required Date field to accept weekend entries, though the Package Schedule will continue to calculate using Monday through Friday only. Previously, Stratus would automatically change the date to the nearest weekday.

update Updated the **Assign New User Role** dialog (Admin > Company > Users > New User > Next) and the **Update User** dialog (Admin > Company > Users > Update User) to support sorting by the checked project column and to display only active Project Names.

update Updated the Insulation Specification Property value to “Not Set” when it is set to “off” in the Fabrication Database.

update Updated the Packages Dashboard to support report data table sorting by up to five Report Sort Indexes. Note: Any indexes beyond the 5th will not be applied.

update Updated Stratus API messaging to return a clear error message when a non-existing “**ViewId**” is used in the “**GET /v1/model/{id}/report/{reportid}**” request. The API now correctly displays the message **"View with ID '<id>' was not found."**

update Updated the Knowledge Base with print setup instructions for configuring computers running the Stratus Workstation app. Refer to the [IT Department Instructions](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2132574209/Labels+ZPL+Printers+Codes+Troubleshooting+and+Configuration#IT-Department-Instructions "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2132574209/Labels+ZPL+Printers+Codes+Troubleshooting+and+Configuration#IT-Department-Instructions") section within the Labels, ZPL Printers, Codes, Troubleshooting, and Configuration article.

Fixed Fixed a Stratus Workstation issue scrolling the list of cut list items.

Fixed Fixed a Display Modes issue where hanger and rod colors did not update to match the Tracking Display Mode color settings.

Fixed Fixed a Models Viewer issue where part Item Number tags in View A persisted in View B, even when those parts were not included in View B. Tags now correctly display only on parts included in the active view.

Fixed Fixed a Package Task issue where moving a task card to the Done column triggered an "Error updating task status" message. The root cause was that the task configured to label print was not assigned to a Station causing the print to fail. This fix suppresses the error if no station is assigned. For more information on how to configure a task to label print, see the [**Example: Label Printing Triggered by Tasks**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217711302/Task+Definitions+Admin#Example%3A-Label-Printing-Triggered-by-Tasks "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217711302/Task+Definitions+Admin#Example%3A-Label-Printing-Triggered-by-Tasks") Knowledge Base article or the [**Stratus Academy**](https://academy.stratus.build/ "https://academy.stratus.build/") course **ADM-518: Task Definitions**.

## 5 May 2025 - 7.6.1030

Installers This release does include new Revit/AutoCAD Stratus Addin for 2026 support.

ADDED Added to the Stratus Addin support for Revit/AutoCad 2026.

**Urgent Note:** Fabrication CADmep 2026 is currently having a license initialization issue. Ensure, CADmep is fully initialized and licensed prior to publishing to Stratus.

-   **No license issue:** Acad 2026 RTM product version is W.60.0.0
    
-   **Causes license issue:** Acad 2026.0.1 product version is W.74.0.0
    

**Issue:** If users attempt to open a model in CADmep, and their first click is to publish in the Stratus Addin, this error modal may appear and the application will shut down.

**Note**: Autodesk is actively working on this issue.

**Work-around**

1.  Download this version of AutoCAD.
    
2.  If AutoCAD 2026.0.1 has already been downloaded, the following is a work-around until Autodesk has an update.
    
    1.  If creating a new model:
        
        1.  After the first click to add a part, the Licence failure will appear.
            
        2.  Click OK.
            
        3.  Click to add the part again.
            
        4.  User will be able to proceed to create model and publish.
            
    2.  If publishing an existing model:
        
        1.  Click to add a part, the Licence failure will appear.
            
        2.  Click OK.
            
        3.  User will be able to proceed to publish the model.
            
        4.  Click Publish button on the Stratus Addin.
            

ADDED Added to Big Data a SQL data table that includes Big Data Updates including the last refreshed date-time. This data table will automatically populate the PowerBI Data when any Big Data update is made such as clicking the **Rebuild Data** button is clicked from Admin > Company > Big Data or when any scheduled update is executed.

ADDED Added a divider separating 3D Views from 2D Views.

ADDED Added a Report drop-down in Assemblies > Stratus Sheet, aligning the selection process for Stratus Sheet reports with that of Packages > Stratus Sheet. In addition, the Report drop-down options are restricted based on the View selected, either 3D or 2D. If a 3D View is selected, only Report Templates that include a 3D View element (Ex. Top View, Front View, Isometric View) will display. Similarly, when a 2D View is selected, only Report Templates that include the 2D Plan View element will display.

ADDED Added a report property to list a part’s View Names, STRATUS.Part.ViewNames. One purpose of this property is to identify whether a part is visible in specific views when generating a report for the entire model.

ADDED Added Stratus Publish messaging for errors that occur during the import process. Below is an example:

ADDED Added the **ArrayMultiply**() function for use with STRATUS.Ancillary.\* reporting.

ArrayMultiply()

Returns array of product results from array1\[0..n\] times array2\[0..n\] in semi-colon separated list of values with provided precision

**Syntax:** ArrayMultiply(array1, array2, precision=0)

**Example:** Field: ArrayMultiply({STRATUS.Ancillary.Quantity},{STRATUS.Ancillary.Length},2)

The STRATUS.Field.Frank Ancillary Part 4 field multiples STRATUS.Ancillary.Quantity x STRATUS.Ancillary.Length and results in the following:

ADDED Added to the Generate Deliverables dialog under Projects > Deliverables, a search box that searches for characters in model names. Note that neither the Deliverable Definition (Ex. Sheet Metal) or Package Category (Ex. 5. Sheet Metal Fab) is searched using the search box.

update Improved the performance of reports run from Models > Viewer > Actions > Reports.

update Updated the IndexOf() and LastIndexOf() functions to effectively find the closed parentheses “)” in a string.

update Eliminated unnecessary messaging during CAMduct publishing:

update Updated Project Role permissions for the Containers > Assign tab making it so that a user is not required to also have the Containers > Dashboard Project Role permission.

Fixed Fixed an issue deleting notes that were created from the Packages or Assemblies Notes tab.

Fixed Fixed an issue that was allowing packages to appear on the Package Dashboard that did not match the dashboard filter criteria.

Fixed Fixed a Projects > Deliverables issue Generating Packages where the package Naming Convention was not properly applied under certain conditions.

Fixed Fixed a package naming issue when using the "New Package" button on the Packages Dashboard.

Fixed Fixed an issue under Packages > Items where after changing the assembly status (Ex. Issued for Fabrication), its child parts did not update to the same status.

Fixed Fixed a Point List issue under Jobsites > Station where after a Point List had been sent to a Station, it did not display on the Jobsites > Station page.

## 17 April 2025 - 7.6.1017

This release does not include any new installers.

ADDED Added to Big Data the ability to configure a Container report. Currently, reports only display in PowerBI.

update Updated the dashboards (Packages, Assemblies, Containers) with a notable performance improvement. The "**Show Entries**" option "**All**" has been removed and replaced with a maximum of **500** entries per page. For instance, if the dashboard contains 10,000 records, each pagination button at the bottom right can promptly display up to 500 rows. However, when either the **CSV** or **Excel** button is clicked to download the file, all 10,000 rows in this example must be loaded first. This process might take some time, depending on the dashboard report's complexity.

Fixed Fixed a dimensioning issue where Stratus dimension values now match CAMduct dimension values.

Fixed Fixed an issue where the part data table was not sorting STRATUS.Part.Number in alphanumeric order.

Fixed Fixed an issue where any STRATUS.Part.PackageXXX property expression (Ex. STRATUS.Part.PackageNumber) was not displaying values when used in reports.

Fixed Fixed an issue in the Assembly Viewer where nested parts could not be selected; parts are now selectable with a single click and correctly linked to the Parts report.

Fixed Fixed a report issue where neither the STRATUS.Assembly.Container or STRATUS.Package.Container field data did not display.

known issue On the Assemblies Dashboard, Checkbox selections are not preserved when filters are modified or when navigating between pages of results. The Stratus team is actively working on a solution that will be implemented in an upcoming update.

Fixed Fixed an issue where CAMduct and Field Orderz published packages would not load in the Packages Viewer.

## 2 March 2025 - 7.6.1004

ADDED Added startup messaging to Stratus Workstation. The processes behind these checks also detect that the workstation is starting up correctly.

ADDED Added new trigonometry functions that can be used in Field Expressions including:

sin, cos, tan, atan, atan2, asin, acos, cot, sec, csc

**Syntax**:

Most take (value, units as 0=radians (default) or 1=degrees)

atan2 takes (y, x, units (optional))

update Updated the AsMetric() function used in Field Expressions so that 1, 2, 3, or 4 arguments can be passed. For example, using the following arguments the metric unit of measurement will be visible on reports:

Precision (optional number of decimal places, defaults to 0),  
Format (optional, defaults to 0, 0=mm, 1=cm, 2=m),  
Display Units (optional, defaults to 0, 0=OFF, 1=ON)

update Updated the report engine to prevent certain errors so that the report generates correctly.

Fixed Fixed an issue generating automated report configured under Package Categories.

Fixed Fixed a Stratus Workstation issue when using filters, the app would occasionally freeze.

Fixed Fixed an Admin Package Category issue where the Report Fields of the selected "Package Creation Report" included a display order, however, that display order was incorrect under the Packages > Properties > Additional Fields section.

## 23 February 2025 - 7.5.1058

ADDED Added new part properties for new model publishes:

1.  Fabrication Body Area (No Allowances)
    
2.  Fabrication Skin Area (No Allowances)
    

update Updated messaging when generating a MAJ from the Packages Dashboard and a Fabrication Job Error message displays. The message will include one of the reasons below as to why the MAJ creation failed.

1.  Model is not found.
    
2.  Latest version of the model not found.
    
3.  Source MAJ files not found.
    

update Updated Cut List Mappings are now visible in Admin > Company > Activities.

Fixed Fixed an API error after scheduled maintenance.

Fixed Fixed an issue where after an Admin updated a user’s first name or last name, the change did not immediately display when the user logged out, then back in.

Fixed In rare cases, Assembly Stratus Sheets in a Master Report were showing annotation lines from the Package Assembly Tags when run from the package viewer or as an automated report generated by Tracking Status changes configured in the Package Categories tab of the Company Admin.

Fixed Increased performance in the speed of creating assemblies and displaying certain reports.

## 06 November 2024 - 7.5.1014 (Release was rolled back to 7.5.1013)

update The first phase of a long-term effort towards simplifying our reporting engine codebase has gone live.

Increased performance in the speed of creating assemblies and displaying certain reports.

Fixed Fixed an issue running a report that includes a Field with an Alias.

## 24 October 2024 - 7.5.1013

update Updated Part Report > Report Fields where **Aggregate** is either Sum or Average and **Merge Like Values** is set to Yes to ensure that the total is based on having a common Description, Material and Size.

update Updated backend report engine code. This change may impact client code written against our Open API for pulling down reports.

**Warning:** When generating reports with the Open API, some fields will now result in strings being empty vs. null. This change may impact client parsing software that operates on data from our Open API.

Fixed Fixed an issue selecting nested families in a Viewer Filter.

Fixed Fixed an issue adding/removing nested family parts to/from an assembly or package.

Fixed Fixed a Container Details report issue when a Report Fields **Merge Like Values** was set to Yes, the report now displays the merged sum and quantity.

Fixed Fixed an issue where a Filters Grouping was applied to a ZPL (label) report, the alphanumeric order was incorrect.

## 14 October 2024 - 7.5.1011

ADDED A new Field format called _QRCode_ has been added to reports.

When the report type is CSV, the value of the field/property will still be rendered as a string.

ADDED New API call for creating a new assembly.

-   POST /v1/model/{id}/assembly
    

ADDED 2 new API endpoints used to automate project import from Autodesk and project creation in Stratus and control over project role assignments for the new project.

Examples:  
AsMetric({Length})

AsMetric({Length},2)

AsMetric({Length},2,2)

where the 2nd and 3rd arguments are optional as specified above

ADDED Markups Project Role permissions (Create & Edit, Delete, and View) in both Assemblies and Packages Attachments.

update Admin > Company > Big Data > Analytics Reports to include Service Principal Authentication fields (Optional).

update Publish to include the Fabrication Data property “Item Drawing Name” value which will display in Stratus Properties.

The dashboard showcases all of your existing sketches. From here, you can easily delete, duplicate, or create a package using your sketch.

On the right side of the page, you have access to a variety of tools. Currently, you can create tags, add dimensions, insert valves, fittings, and unions, as well as delete, undo, and redo actions.

To draw a pipe, simply ensure no tools are selected and drag your finger between two points. To add annotations or valves/fittings, select the appropriate tool from the right side of the screen and follow the tooltips located at the bottom right corner for guidance.

## TigerStop and RazorGage

For the TigerStop and RazorGage cutting tools, the settings and user interface are the same. However, the communication with the tool is determined by the selected Tool Type on the System tab. See the [**System Tool Type Selection**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201687060/Stratus+Workstation#System-Tool-Type-Selection "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201687060/Stratus+Workstation#System-Tool-Type-Selection") section for instructions on switching to either the TigerStop or RazorGage Tool Type.

## Settings

1.  Start the application through the Windows Start menu or another shortcut.
    
    1.  **Note**: Stratus Workstation can be run from any computer.
        
2.  You may be prompted to enter your Autodesk credentials.
    
3.  Click **Settings** in the bottom right of the app. The following tabs will display.  
    

### General

The General tab is used to select a Tool and other options.

1.  **Company** - Select the company when you have access to more than one BIM 360 hub.
    
2.  **Tool** - Select the tool. Many companies have several tools defined for different materials or sizes and each tool includes it’s own label template defined by the Admin.
    
    1.  **Note: Tools** are configured under Admin > Company > Tools and display in this list when **Type** is set to **Cutlist**. 
        
3.  **Apply Tracking Status on Done** (Optional) - Select the Tracking Status that the **part** should be updated to after it is cut. Only Tracking Statuses under Admin > Company > Tracking Statuses where **Applies to Part** is checked should display as options.
    
4.  **Complete Task on Done** (Optional) - Select the Task that should be updated after the cut. Only Tasks associated with the selected Tool under Admin > Company > Stations > [**Task Definitions**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2146995835 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2146995835") will display in the drop-down list. See the **Stratus Settings** sub-section [**Complete Task On Done**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201687060/Stratus+Workstation#STRATUSWorkstation-NewTaskDefinitiontoUpdate "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201687060/Stratus+Workstation#STRATUSWorkstation-NewTaskDefinitiontoUpdate") below for more information.
    
5.  **Print Labels** (Optional) - Check this box if you are printing to a Zebra compatible label printer immediately following any cut. **Note**: Each tool has its own label defined by the Admin.
    
6.  **Label Printer** (Optional) - Select the **Label Printer** to be used for printing labels. A **Label Printer** Tool is configured under Admin > Company > Tools and display in this list when **Type** is set to **ZPL Printer**. 
    
7.  **SIGN OUT** - **User A** can sign out and then **User B** can sign in.
    
8.  **SAVE** - Click **Save** to save any setting changes.
    
9.  **CANCEL** - Click **Cancel** to cancel and not save any changes.
    
10.  **TEST** - Use the **Test** button to find a TigerStop when the application is already running. If the app is launched after a TigerStop is running, the COM port will be automatically located.
    

### Cut

The Cut tab is used to define how cutting information displays and how the tool is controlled.

1.  **Blade Thickness (in)** - Enter the thickness or kerf of the blade which is the width of material removed by a cutting tool.
    
2.  **Cut Length Display Units** - The **Cut Length Display Units** option toggles the display units to either Fractional Feet-Inches (Default) or Fractional Inches. See the Cut Length Display Units section for more information.
    
3.  **Cut Length Precision** - The **Cut Length Precision** setting (Default = 1/16”) only applies to Length display and to printed labels. See the [**Cut Length Precision**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201687060/Stratus+Workstation#STRATUSWorkstation-CutLengthPrecision "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201687060/Stratus+Workstation#STRATUSWorkstation-CutLengthPrecision") section below for more information.
    
4.  **Round Up** - The **Round Up** checkbox setting (Default = Unchecked) applies to the actual cut length value. See the [**Round Cut Length Up**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201687060/Stratus+Workstation#STRATUSWorkstation-RoundCutLengthUp "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/201687060/Stratus+Workstation#STRATUSWorkstation-RoundCutLengthUp") section below for more information. 
    
5.  **Stock Length** - Enter the nominal stock length in inches.
    
    1.  **Tip**: For precise first cuts, if the stock length varies, pre-cut the stock piece to match the exact Stock Length specified here.
        
6.  **Load Offset (in)** - When in the Push Dimension Mode, every time a new piece of stock is expected to be loaded (moving stop to stock length), this adds the 'Load Offset' length to the distance. This value makes it easier to load the material. Load Offset can be a positive or negative number. A negative number would be used for the Kwik-Snap Cast Iron Pipe Cutter use case where Stratus Workstation Dimension Mode is set for BackStop the first cut is off by 0.125 as it did not account for the Kwik-Snap chains.
    
    1.  The head of stop should be Stock Length (48") + Load Offset (9") = 57" from the blade when a new stock is expected to be loaded.
        
    2.  The first press of move will move the stop to stock length, if the offset is 9", the fence will move 9" on the first push.
        
    3.  A second press of the move button will act as the first press of move does currently and move the stop to make the first cut.
        
7.  **Minimum Length (in)** - The minimum amount of stock material length in inches – meaning the Workstation App cannot move the tool to a position that is less than this minimum. Remaining stock length cannot be less than this minimum.
    
8.  **Maximum Scrap Length (in)** - Filters out uncut material that is **not** long enough to be used for stock in another cut. Only uncut material less <= **Max. Scrap Length** will be considered scrap and included in the calculation for total scrap. Consider making this greater than the Minimum Length of cuts. If the “actual” material remaining should display as scrap, enter the stock length value as the **Max. Scrap Length** and everything uncut will be considered scrap. **Note**: This setting controls the **Scrap Display Units** value.
    
9.  **Scrap Display Units** - For the selected material and size, scrap units can be set to Percentage (Total scrap length over stock length), Fractional Feet-Inches, or Fractional Inches.
    
10.  **Stock Display Units** - Select an option (Ex. Pieces of Stock, Fractional Feet-Inches (below), or Fractional Inches). In Stratus Workstation, the icon and value will display.
    
11.  **Keep Long End Last Stock Cut** - When checked the last cut of a nested series, the tail end, will be the longest piece to cut. This is a good operator safety option to a small piece is not the last to be cut.
    
12.  **Dimension Mode** - Backstop mode or Push Mode.
    
    1.  **BackStop** indicates that the movement of material is towards the cutting tool's backstop. This is a good option for cast iron where the shop has a spring loaded backstop.
        
    2.  **Push** indicates material is pushed in a direction away from the cutting tool's backstop.
        
13.  **Movement Direction** - Display cuts on stock material to match the flow of material on the cutting tool.
    
14.  **Test** - Use the **Test** button to find a TigerStop when the application is already running. If the app is launched after a TigerStop is running, the COM port will be automatically located.
    

### Workstation

**Note**: Configure all items up to **Automated Cutting** unless the shop has an automated cutting saw. Skip these items if the shop has an automated cutting saw.

1.  **Use Trigger** - When checked, the cutting machine’s trigger activates the saw to cut the material.
    
2.  **Trigger Timeout (sec)** - Amount of time to wait for detection of a trigger before notifying the user that the tool did not cycle.
    
3.  **Move on Trigger Cycle** - When checked, automatically marks an item as “Done” and moves the tool to next cut or resets stock length at end nested cuts.
    
4.  **Move Wait Time (sec)** - Amount of time to wait before marking an item as “Done” and automatically moving tool. Be sure that the **Move Wait Time** in seconds is greater than the **Move Delay** in seconds from the TigerStop. It is recommend to add an additional second to make sure there’s no toe stepping.
    
    1.  Validate a cut list:
        
        1.  Validate that you are seeing the proper retract and take-up of that retract distance while the tool is cycling, even on the first cut piece out of a stock length.
            
        2.  Validate that the cut lengths are as expected.
            
5.  **Automated Cutting** – When checked, indicates the shop is using an automatic cutting saw rather than a trigger saw (above settings). The cutting tool will automatically cycle. For TigerStop, the optional Advanced Interconnect Kit - AIK is required.
    
6.  **Homing Timeout (sec)** - The **Homing Timeout** value determines how long it takes to move the sled from blade back to furthest extent. 60 seconds is good for a 20' pusher but can be adjusted for different sized pushers.
    
7.  **Move Retry Enabled** - When checked, the **Move Retry Enabled** feature will detect that the move failed and will retry the move up to 3 times. The cause of failed moves can vary and has been attributed to bad cabling or a loss of information glitch over a noisy line. Additionally, some successful moves were incorrectly reported as failures because the pusher relayed its progress before reaching the destination.
    

### System

1.  **Com Port** - Windows hardware port number used for serial communication to a TigerStop or RazorGage.
    
    1.  Note: On startup, Workstation looks for a Com Port.
        
2.  **Baud Rate** - The RazorGage and TigerStop speed of communication on the given Com Port.
    
3.  **Tool Type** - Select what kind of hardware your Workstation App is talking to. See the [**System Tool Type Selection**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2898362369/Copy+of+Stratus+Workstation#System-Tool-Type-Selection "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/2898362369/Copy+of+Stratus+Workstation#System-Tool-Type-Selection") section for instructions on switching to other Tool Types.
    
4.  **Debug Browser** - Turn this on to see more login information in a browser helper window.
    
5.  **Remember Login Session** - Turn this on to have cookies store your login tokens.
    
6.  **Simulation Mode** - Simulates an attached cutting machine and provides the ability to print labels but won't move the sled or automate the saw.
    

## Summary: Cut List Interface

In Stratus under the Package's Cut List tab, as soon as the **Send Cut List to Station** button is clicked, the cut list displays in the Stratus Workstation application associated with that station. Below is an example. 

1.  **Filter and Grouping** \- Filter and Group the cut list queue by Project, Model, Package, Spool/Assembly, Area, or Item Grouping.
    
2.  **Connected to the Remote Hub** \- When grayed out, the computer is not connected to the Stratus. When white, the computer is connected to the Stratus.
    
3.  **Workstation is connected**
    
    1.  **Workstation is connected** - The connectivity icon color will be white.
        
    2.  **Workstation is not connected**:
        
        1.  The connectivity icon color will be red.
            
        2.  The message “**Workstation not connected. Setting Manual Cutting Mode.”** prompt will display.
            
        3.  **Manual Cutting Mode** will display in the bottom left.
            
        4.  **Note**: When cutting in manual mode, the "Remaining" stock length does not change when you press **Done**, as it is up to the person cutting to manage the material and the scrap.
            
4.  **Filter and Grouping Current Settings** \- Displays the selections made under Filters and Groupings.
    
5.  **Tool** - The currently selected tool under Settings.
    
6.  **Scrap Display Units** \- Decimal Inches (shown) or percentage is total scrap length over stock length. This value is controlled by the **Maximum Scrap Length** configured under Settings > Cut.
    
7.  **Reset Stock** - Click **Reset Stock** to set the "Remaining" stock length to configured in Settings. You can also key in a value and press enter or push the reset stock button.
    
8.  **Remaining** - The stock remaining after each cut.  **Note**: When cutting in manual mode, the "Remaining" stock length does not change when you press Done, as it is up to the person cutting to manage the material and the scrap. Manually setting a value will renest the pieces in the table. As a result, the length of a scrap piece of material can be entered and as many pieces as possible will be nested.
    
9.  **Move** - To start cutting a new stick:
    
    1.  The operator must click the **Move** button.
        
    2.  The operator is prevented from making a cut when the part length is longer than the stock length.
        
    3.  The TigerStop will be positioned for the first cut. The operator will make the cut. 
        
    4.  In Settings, if **Print Labels** is checked and a **Label Printer** is selected, then a label will be printed. For label configuration, see the [**Label Printing for Zebra (ZPL) Compatible Printers**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/157974545 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/157974545") article. **Note**: If labels are modified in Stratus, the updated label will not apply to existing cut lists in Stratus Workstation, rather, the cut list needs to be unassigned from the Cut List tab and then resent to the station.
        
    5.  In Settings, if the **Move on Trigger Cycle is checked**, the TigerStop will be automatically positioned to the next cut after the designated **Move Wait Time** setting.
        
    6.  The top row and Last Cut Item will update.
        
    7.  **Note**: Cut List items cannot be selected out of the nested order.
        
10.  **Done** - If the **Move on Trigger Cycle** is not checked, then the operator can click the Done button to trigger the TigerStop to move to the next position.
    
11.  **Pause** - **Pause** will interrupt the stock material workflow.   When paused, the user can use the green TigerStop keypad to move the tool to a specified length. Then they can resume with an option to keep the current stock length or use the previous one.
    
12.  **Delete** - **Delete** is used more by testers than operators. Delete will delete the selected item(s) from the cut list. The item(s) will be orphaned from the cut list and the status of the cut list in Stratus will not reach 100% complete. Use this option as a last resort. Only the top row can be deleted, a cut list item in the middle of the list cannot be deleted.

## Details: Cut List Interface

### Filter and Grouping

Filter and Group the cut list queue by Project, Model, Package, Spool/Assembly, Area, or Item Grouping.

1.  **Filter to Individual Items** - Expand Model, Package, Spool / Assembly, Area to select/deselect individual items. As items are checked/unchecked, they are filtered in/out of the tool list. 
    
    **Note**: Click All Packages to select all packages in within the selected Project and Model. Long lists of assemblies or packages can take up to a minute to check or uncheck All items.
    
    1.  **Checked** - When checked, all items will be checked and **All** will display in the drop-down (Ex. All Packages).
        
    2.  **Unchecked** - When unchecked all items will be unchecked and the drop-down will be blank.
        
    3.  **Mix Checked/Unchecked** - When individual items are checked and other items are unchecked, the selected item names will display in the drop-down (Ex. Model reads GTP - ITM - Revit - Mechanical) as to fill the space. The space is not designed to display all checked, just click the drop-down to view.
        
2.  **Item Grouping** - Nested items can be grouped By Package, By Assembly, Item Number, Area, or No Item Grouping.
    
3.  **Batch Size** - The **Batch Size** option creates cut list subgroups that will be cut before moving to the next subgroup. A Batch Size subgroup is used in combination with the Item Grouping (By Package, By Assembly, By Item Number) options. The purpose of a subgroup is to nest parts in a Batch according to the Item Grouping. If the Batch Size is 2 or more, all parts for the first two Item Groupings will be cut before moving to the next batch of 2. Currently, for a large list of cut list items, Stratus Workstation optimizes the cuts to reduce waste which means the order that parts from different assemblies or packages are cut may not be optimal for assembly or shipping.
    
    For example:
    
    1.  With **No Item Grouping**, the Assembly sort order is random.
        
    2.  Set **Item Grouping** to By Assembly. The list is sorted by Assembly.
        
    3.  **Batch Size**
        
        1.  **Unchecked** (default) - When unchecked the cut list will not enforce subgroups.
            
        2.  **Checked** \- When checked, the cut list will be organized in batches specified by the number entered. The cut list order may change.
            
            1.  If Batch Size is 1, all parts for each assembly will be cut before moving to another assembly.
                
            2.  If Batch Size is 2+, all parts for the first two assemblies will be cut before moving to the next batch of 2+ assemblies.
                
                1.  As a result, the cut list will sort assemblies so that all parts for the first two assemblies will be cut before moving to the next batch of 2+ assemblies and a different assembly won’t be inserted in between. Notice that once the last -12 and -13 assembly has been cut, then the -14 assembly can be cut.
                    
                2.  Similarly, in this example with Batch Size = 3, the -12, -13, and -14 assemblies are cut before moving on to the -103 assembly.
                    

### Load Next Stock Material

When the last item from a cut list material and size is cut, a message similar to the following will display. The purpose of the message is to inform the operator that a \*\*\* NEW MATERIAL \*\*\* needs to be loaded. The name of the new material size to load is included.

### Cut Length Precision

The **Cut Length Precision** setting (Default = 1/16”) only applies to Length display and to printed labels. To change the Cut Length Precision:

1.  The cut list displays the Length values.
    
2.  Click Settings > **Cut Length Precision** drop-down. Select a value (Ex. 1/2”) and then click **Save**.
    
3.  The cut list page will refresh and display the cut Length values with the defined precision.
    
4.  When the part is cut, the actual length will be cut, not the precision display value.
    
5.  The label cut length will include the precision display value.
    

### Cut Length Display Units

The Cut Length Display Units option toggles the display units to either Fractional Feet-Inches (Default) or Fractional Inches.

1.  By default, Cut Length Display Units are Fractional Feet-Inches.
    
2.  Under Settings > Cut Length Display Units, select an option (Ex. Fractional Inches).
    
3.  The Cut Length will display Fractional Inches.
    
4.  Configure the Tool label template to use the field lengthInInches. For example:  
    ^FO175,160  
    ^FD{{lengthInInches}}^FS
    
5.  When the label prints the cut length will display as Fractional Inches.
    

### Round Cut Length Up

The **Round Cut** checkbox setting (Default = Unchecked) applies to the actual cut length value.

**To change the Round Cut value:**

1.  The cut list displays the Length values.
    
2.  Under Settings, the **Round Cut** checkbox displays.
    
    1.  **Unchecked** (Default) - When unchecked, the cut length will be the actual cut length value.
        
    2.  **Checked** \- When checked, the actual cut length will be rounded according to the Cut Length Precision setting.
        
3.  Click **Save**.
    
4.  With the Round Cut checkbox checked, the cut list page will refresh and display the actual cut length rounded according to the Cut Length Precision setting.
    
5.  The cut and label will use the new cut length.
    

### History

To re-print a label or re-cut an item:

1.  Click the **History** button.
    
2.  Previously cut items will display. Select an item.
    
    1.  **Print** \- Print the item’s label.
        
    2.  **Move** \- Re-cut the item. You will be informed that the tool position will be moved. The presumptive workflow is that an operator who needs to re-cut a previously cut piece will remove their current in-progress stock, place a different piece of stock on the platform and cut the stock in backstop mode.
        
    3.  Click **OK** to move the tool position and make the cut.
        
    4.  **Close** or **X** \- Click Close or the X button to close the window. The operator will be prompted:
        
        1.  **Continue from previous position** \- Remaining stock will be the previous position value. The operator can place the original stock back on the platform to carry on as though they never stopped cutting. The cut list will not have been changed.
            
        2.  **Reset stock and continue** \- Functions as if the Reset Stock button was clicked, thereby setting Remaining to the Stock Length value and re-nesting the cut list.
            

### Scrap Material

Scrap material from one standard stock can be used for the first cut of the next spool For example, Spool B2 uses the remaining scrap from previous stock and then moves to a new piece of stock to continue nesting cuts.

### Bundle

Bundling allows the operator to cut more than one item at a time to the same length, think of multiple all-thread rods or unistrut strapped together destined for a band-saw. The Bundling feature supports TigerStop, Nesting, and Labels. It's important to note, Bundling will only work in the 'Backstop Mode' with a TigerStop. Bundling is a session-specific task, so if a bundle is made, the Stratus Workstations application is closed and reopened, the bundle will need to be recreated. The Bundle feature can also be used with the TigerStop AIK setup.

To use the Bundle feature:

1.  Under Packages > Package > Cut Lists, send a cut list to a station.
    
2.  At the station, open the **Stratus Workstation** application.
    
3.  Click the cut list. A dialog similar to the following will display. Notice the identical lengths and the **Bundle** button.
    
4.  Click the **Bundle** button. The Maximum Bundle Size dialog will display. Here the Bundle Size can be set to whatever the saw can handle. If the Bundle Size had previously been set and needs to be changed, it can be changed here as well.
    
5.  Once the Bundle Size is set, click **Close**. A message will display that the TigerStop will run in “**backstop mode**.” Click **OK**.
    
    1.  **Note**: If a different cut list is selected where a Bundle Size has not been set, a message will display that the TigerStop will run in “**push mode**”. Click **OK**. Clock **Close** on the Maximum Bundle Size dialog.
        
6.  Now that the Stratus Workstation is setup in “backstop mode” it is ready to move and cut normally. Notice the following:
    
    1.  **Bundle Size** - The Bundle Size is the count of the currently selected bundle.
        
    2.  **Bundle Max** – The Bundle Max is the value entered in the Maximum Bundle Size dialog above.
        
    3.  **Count** – The count column nests the items that will be cut together in a bundle.
        
    4.  **Cut List Bundle Icon** – After a Bundle Max value has been saved for a cut list, the Bundled icon will display on the tab.
        
7.  Move and cut normally. As you cut, bundles will disappear from the screen. Cut bundles, like normal cuts, can be viewed by clicking the **History** button.  If the same computer running the application is used for multiple Stratus tools (Ex. a copper tool, a steel tool, etc.), the history for each selected Stratus tool will be unique. 
    
8.  To “**Unbundle**” a bundle, click the Bundle button and then click the Unbundle button and OK. The dialog informs that the bundle no longer exists and default cutting settings are active.
    
9.  Click **Close**. The page will refresh, and the **Count** column will disappear indicating that all bundles have returned to unique cuts and the Bundle Max and Size data will disappear.
    

## TigerStop Manual Overrides

### Material Retractions with TigerStop

Retractions of material when using a TigerStop are handled by the tool/amp/controller and are not a feature of the Stratus Workstation App. This can be accomplished with a few simple changes to the TigerStop controller settings. Per TigerStop on the functionality of the DM Only option for the Retract Type setting, "The Retract move will happen as soon as the Dead-Man circuit opens when using a TigerStop Interconnect Kit." The following are Settings in the TigerStop controller (the green keypad).

1.  Go to the Options Menu.
    
    1.  Set the **Retract Type** to _DM Only._
        
    2.  Set your **Retract** distance in inches.
        
    3.  Validate that your **Retract Offset** is set to _0.000in_. You should only have a non-zero value here if the cutting operation physically moves the stock material towards the direction of the pusher.
        
2.  Go to the Motion Menu.
    
    1.  Please validate that the **Move Delay** in seconds on the TigerStop is less than the **Move Wait Time** in seconds on the Stratus Workstation App. Any physical restrictions on the tool and in its operational settings should be calculated and accounted for. Do not arbitrarily make your **Move Delay** less than the **Move Wait Time** and beware that the value you enter on the TigerStop is in milliseconds.
        

## Stratus Settings

### Complete Task On Done

See the [**Task Definitions (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217711302 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217711302") article for complete information and a link to the [**Stratus Academy**](https://academy.stratus.build/ "https://academy.stratus.build/") course **ADM-518: Task Definitions**.

Companies can use Task Definition for intermediate steps between major tracking status changes.  For example, they may have "In Fabrication" and "Fabrication Completed" as their tracking statuses, but they have a Task Definition associated with parts that include individual tasks for steps like "Cut".

The Stratus Workstation application currently includes the **Apply Tracking Status on Done** setting which is used to update a tracking status when a cut is completed. The **Complete Task On Done** setting is used to update a part Task (if one exists).

To use this feature:

1.  **Configure Task Definitions**.
    
2.  **Configure a Tool.**
    
3.  **Configure a Task Workflow for a part**.
    
    1.  **Apply to Type** = Part
        
    2.  **Initiated by Tracking Status** = Issued for Fabrication (in this case)
        
4.  **Configure a Station**. The Station is associated with the Tool and the Task Definitions. When the Stratus Workstation is opened (below) and this Tool is selected, the Task Definitions will be available in the New Task Definition to Update setting.
    
5.  **Create a Package**.
    
6.  In the Tracking tab, change the Status of the “Package to Issued for Fabrication” which is the setting for the **Initiated by Tracking Status** configured in the Task Workflow created (above).
    
    1.  Tasks are created on the Tasks tab.
        
    2.  The Task Workflow is automatically assigned to each part on the Package’s Items tab.
        
7.  **Generate a Cut Lists -** In the Package’s **Cut List** tab, click the **Generate a Cut Lists** The Cut Lists will display.
    
8.  Check to select one or more Cut Lists and then click the **Send Cut List to Station** button.
    
9.  **Stratus Workstation -** Open the **Stratus Workstation** and click **Settings**.
    
10.  Click the **Complete Task on Done** drop-down. Select a status for the tasks to receive once a part is cut.
    
11.  Once set, make a cut from the cut list.
    
12.  The Package's Item tab will show the task is complete as the task button turns green.
    

### Remove Cut List from a Station

In Stratus under the Package's Cut List tab, as soon as the **Send Cut List to Station** button is clicked, the cut list displays in the Stratus Workstation application associated with that station.

If the cut list was sent to the wrong station or needs to be removed from the Stratus Workstation queue, it can be quickly removed in a couple of ways:

1.  Under the Package's **Cut List** tab either:
    
    1.  Click the **Unassign from Station** button. This will remove the cut list from the station and the Stratus Workstation queue, but will not delete the cut list from the package. This will enable a user to select a different station and **Send Cut List to Station** again.
        
    2.  Click the **Delete** button. This will delete the cut list from the package. A user will need to **Generate Cut Lists** for the package in order for the cut list to be available after being deleted.
        
2.  Under **Shops** > **Station** (select) > **Tools** (select) a list of cut lists for the station and tool will display.
    
    1.  Click the **Unassign from Station** button. This will remove the cut list from the station and the Stratus Workstation queue, but will not delete the cut list from the package.
        

### Rename Package

**Note:**  If a user changes the name of a package after sending a cut list to the Stratus Workstation, the old package name will continue to display in the Stratus Workstation. To resolve this issue, delete the cut list and resend it to the Stratus Workstation.

### Status Update

In Stratus under the Package's Cut List tab, as soon as the **Send Cut List to Station** button is clicked, the cut list displays in the Stratus Workstation application associated with that station. The cut list status changes as items are cut.

1.  Package's Cut List tab - When the **Send Cut List to Station** button is clicked, on the Package's Cut List tab the status of the cut list is changed to **In Progress \[0%\]**. 
    
2.  As soon as any cuts are made, the cut list status is updated.
    
    1.  Package's **Cut List** tab - Status column.
        
    2.  **Shops** > **Station** (select) > **Tools** (select) > Status column.
        

## Pre-Checks

In most cases, users can start using the Stratus Workstation App immediately after installation. However, there are instances where certain steps must be handled manually.

## Hardware Setup

When installing a TigerStop for the first time, ensure it is activated. Failure to activate it can result in a disabled COM port, causing the Workstation app to freeze.

## TigerStop Cabling

Connect a serial cable from your Workstation App to the TigerStop pusher, ensuring the cable length does not exceed 20 feet. A repeater is recommended if using a cable 20-foot or longer. Shorter cables perform better, as 50-foot cables have been known to fail, but switching to shorter lengths resolved the issue. **Do not tie or wrap your serial cable / DB9 cable with any power lines/cords.**

### **Sealevel Cabling (Recommended)**

A tablet or PC runs the Stratus Workstation App and communicates with the TigerStop pusher using the cable labeled "Goes to PC Tablet" in the image above. The recommended DB9 to USB cable is sold by SeaLevel: [https://www.sealevel.com/product/2105r-usb-to-1-port-rs-232-db9-serial-interface-adapter/](https://www.sealevel.com/product/2105r-usb-to-1-port-rs-232-db9-serial-interface-adapter/ "https://www.sealevel.com/product/2105r-usb-to-1-port-rs-232-db9-serial-interface-adapter/")

### **Sealevel Software (Recommended)**

Sea Level software is recommended. Download at: [**Software: SeaCOM – Windows**](https://www.sealevel.com/support/software-seacom-windows/ "https://www.sealevel.com/support/software-seacom-windows/"). **Note**: It will be called Port Manager in Windows when you want to run it. The software, when run, looks something like this:

## **Windows OS**

Running the app as an administrator is not required, but the IT department must ensure that the user profile retains write access to the %appdata% section of the hard drive.

## **Firewalls**

The Workstation app uses SignalR (an application that enables instant data updates between servers and the app), over port 443, so the IT department must enable WebSockets through the firewall

**COM Port**

1.  Do not run **TigerTouch** or **TigerLink** simultaneously with the **Stratus Workstation App** on the same computer, as they will compete for the COM port, causing the Workstation App to fail.
    
2.  To determine if TigerTouch or TigerLink is running, open Windows Task Manager.
    
    1.  On the left side of this program, click on the startup app icon.
        
    2.  **Disable** either the TigerLink or TigerTouch if it is running on startup.

# System Requirements - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> A stable, reliable, high-performing internet connection with adequate bandwidth and speed is perhaps the single most important key to success.

---
## Internet

A stable, reliable, high-performing internet connection with adequate bandwidth and speed is perhaps the single most important key to success. 

## Revit / AutoCAD / Fabrication

Revit / AutoCAD versions 2019 or newer are supported.

## Shop Computers

## Desktop/Laptop Minimum

-   64-bit Microsoft® Windows® 10 or Windows 11
-   Intel® i-Series, Xeon®, AMD® Ryzen, Ryzen Threadripper PRO. 2.5 GHz or Higher. The highest affordable CPU speed rating is recommended.
-   16 GB RAM (though more is better)
-   1280 x 1024 with true color (graphics card upgrade with additional RAM is better) 
-   10 GB free disk space 

## Tablet Minimum

-   Surface Pro 7 or newer (standard with **TigerStop**) and recommended over iPads
-   Apple iPad or iPad Pro 
    -   **3/25/22 Note**: The Apple iOS 15.x update includes a memory limit. As a result, in some cases, large models will not load in the STRATUS viewer.  The GTP team has been in communication with Autodesk and tried some changes to get these models to load on the iPad, but these changes have failed. Until this issue is resolved the GTP team recommends to:
        -   simplify geometry for manufacturer-provided part families used within Revit
            
        -   create separate 3D views by area or level and make one of them the default rather than the overall 3D view
            
        -   use non-Apple devices
            
-   16 GB RAM (more is better) 
-   Stylus Pen and keyboard (recommended)

## Zebra Label Printer

-   Windows is required to print labels using the STRATUS Workstation and STRATUS Print applications.
-   [https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra/product-information/en-us/brochures-datasheets/desktop/advanced-desktop-datasheet-en-us.pdf](https://www.zebra.com/content/dam/zebra/product-information/en-us/brochures-datasheets/desktop/advanced-desktop-datasheet-en-us.pdf) 
-   GK-420 – Printer for **TigerStop** Station 
-   GT800 \- desktop printer 
-   ZD410 \- direct thermal printer 
-   TLP2824 Plus \- thermal transfer printer  
-   ZT600 series \- industrial 

## Scanner

To scan a tracking code, the scanner must be integrated with a computer. 

-   NETUM Wireless Barcode Scanner 2.4GHz (need Bluetooth Receiver) 
    -   Example: [NETUM 2D Barcode Scanner, Compatible with 2.4G Wireless & Bluetooth & USB Wired Connection, Connect Smart Phone, Tablet, PC, 1D Bar Code Reader Work for QR PDF417 Data Matrix NT-1228BL](https://www.amazon.com/NETUM-Bluetooth-Handheld-Wireless-NT-1228BL/dp/B07CBS52KJ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1XJ1B1YQ52P1E&keywords=nt-1228BL&qid=1650635934&s=electronics&sprefix=nt-1228bl%2Celectronics%2C96&sr=1-1)

## Wi-Fi

-   High-speed internet with bandwidth for multiple simultaneous connections is very important. 
-   Business-class internet and WIFI is required for shops. 
-   Wireless must provide adequate coverage to all areas of the facility. 

## BIM 360 Requirements

-   While BIM 360 user accounts can be created for a shared login such as [shopworker1@contractor.com](mailto:shopworker@contractor.com) [shopworker2@contractor.com](mailto:shopworker2@contractor.com) etc., this does limit the level of detail provided in tracking logs, as this user will be associated currently with tracking log entries. 
-   We recommend individual user accounts for all modelers, project managers, and foremen.  Shared accounts are acceptable for most shop and field workers. 
-   Shop computers connected to cutting machines (Ex. TigerStop) should each have their own account. 

## Browsers 

-   Google Chrome (Recommended) 
-   Microsoft Edge 
-   Firefox 
-   Safari 

## Fabrication Machinery Supported 

## Pipe Cutters

-   TigerStop 
-   Snap Cutters 
-   Manual Saws 
-   Automated Saws 
-   T-Drill 

## Multi-Axis Pipe and Hole Cutters

-   PypeServer 
-   Watts 
-   Vernon 
-   T-Drill 
-   HGG 
-   .PCF file export available for other machinery 

## Auto-welding Machinery

-   Novarc
-   T-Drill

## Multiple Part Selection and Assembly Selection

The **Multiple Part Selection** and the **Assembly Selection** options can be used by Tablet and iPad users to select multiple parts or assemblies in any of the Viewer pages. Both features work the same. Below is an example of how to use the **Multiple Part Selection** feature:

1.  Click the **Click to Change Settings** gear icon and then select the **Multiple Part Selection** checkbox in the sub-menu.
    
2.  Click either a part or space on the canvas and the sub-menu will disappear.
    
3.  Click multiple parts and they will all be selected.
    
4.  Click the first part, the last part, and then the **Select Connected** tool to select all parts between the 2 initially selected parts.
    
5.  Tools like those under **Actions** can be used once parts are selected.
    
6.  Click in empty space to clear your part selections.
    

## Assembly Viewer Toggle Orientation

Use the Toggle Orientation button to give you more screen width when viewing an assembly with a table.

1.  Below is the default side-by-side view where the Viewer is next to the Parts list.
    
2.  Click the **Toggle Orientation** button (top right) to toggle the page layout.
    
3.  The Parts list will re-orient under the Viewer and both views expand to the width of the tablet.
    
4.  Click the Toggle Orientation button again to restore the side-by-side orientation.
    

## Assembly Parts Table Zoom

To zoom the size of the Part's tab table list, click the minus or plus Table buttons.

## Assembly Stratus Sheet Full Screen and Zoom buttons

1.  Once you have generated a Stratus Sheet under Assemblies > Viewer > Stratus Sheet
    
    1.  To maximize the screen size, click the Full Screen Mode 
        
        button.
        
    2.  To zoom the sheet size, click the Zoom Out or Zoom In button. 
        
2.  Click the **Exit Full Screen Mode**
    
    button to return to the normal view.
    

## Tablet Recommendations

Stratus can run on any web-enabled device. Based on customer feedback, the Customer Success Group recommends Microsoft Surface tablets. Below is a summary.

1.  **Finger navigation** - When navigating with your finger, you are either touching the screen or not. Your finger does not provide any functionality when hovering over an object.
    
2.  **Hover Pen navigation** - (Recommended) Surface tablet pens provide the ability to hover over buttons. Hover 1/8" to 1/4" above the object to view options. (Option) Currently, iPad pens do not provide this functionality. The ability to hover over objects enables you to manually pull dimensions using the Stratus Dimensioning tool. Pens enable operators to keep gloves on and still execute many touchscreen functions. There are some work glove brands that enable use of gloved fingers on touchscreens.
    
3.  **Zoom** - (Recommended) Zoom is the same on any tablet whereby 2 fingers are used to zoom in/out.
    
4.  **Pan** - (Recommended) Select the Forge Viewer's Pan tool to pan the viewer. This allows you to pan with one finger. (Option) With 2 fingers pressing the screen, pan the viewer.
    
5.  **Rotate** - (Recommended) Use the dimension cube to rotate the view with a pen; it's difficult to use with your finger. (Option) With 2 fingers pressing the screen, swivel your 2 fingers to rotate.
    
6.  **Select Multiple parts** - (Recommended) Use the Stratus gear as described above to select multiple parts or to use the Select Connected tool.
    
7.  **Full Screen** - (Recommended) Use the **Toggle Orientation** button (top right) to toggle the page layout so that the Viewer and the Parts list are vertically in full screen mode.(Option) Use the Forge Viewer Full Screen tool which puts the Viewer in full screen mode but eliminates the Parts list.
    
8.  **Display Grid and Grid Offset Measurement tools** - Both tools work well to pull dimensions on any tablet.
    
9.  **Move tags** - Touch tag to select and then touch the target position to move and place the tag. There is no click and drag capability on a tablet.
    
10.  **Manual Dimensioning** - (Recommended) Surface tablet pens provide the ability to hover over buttons which will cycle through and select the dimensioning node. Once selected, drag to place the dimension.
    

## Report Won't Generate on iPad

When a report won't generate (Ex. Models > Viewer > Actions > Report > a CSV or PDF report) on an iPad, the problem is usually with the Safari Pop-Up Blocker.

To fix the issue:

1.  Go to Settings > Safari > Block Pop-Ups and turn off the setting to Block Pop-Ups.

# Viewer Filters Tracking Date Range - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> The Models, Packages, and Assemblies viewers include a Date Range option. The date range option can be used to filters parts displayed in the viewer by when the part changed to a status. This can be useful to run reports for KPIs. For example, it can be used to display all items that have changed to the “Fabricated” status in the last month. All Tracking statuses are displayed in the list even if they do not have matching parts in the viewer.

## Viewer Settings

Viewer Settings are accessed by clicking the **Change Settings** gear icon.

![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2011136001/image2022-12-8_8-35-26.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670510128265&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

## Hidden Parts Shaded

The **Hidden Parts Shaded** checkbox toggles between displaying only the selected parts and non-selected parts so that the selected parts can be viewed within the context of surrounding parts.

**Viewers:** Available in all viewers (Models, Packages, and Assemblies).

To use the **Hidden Parts Shaded** toggle:

1.  Click the **Click to Change Settings** gear icon.
2.  When the **Hidden Parts Shaded** checkbox is **unchecked**, on the selected or filtered parts filtered to will display.![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2011136001/image2022-12-7_14-26-3.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670444764984&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
3.  When the **Hidden Parts Shaded** checkbox is **checked**, non-selected parts are visible in light gray so that the selected parts can be viewed within the context of surrounding parts.![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2011136001/image2022-12-7_14-27-11.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670444832721&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

## Multiple Part Selection

The **Multiple Part Selection** toggle checkbox is used primarily by tablet and iPad users who can't use the Ctrl or Shift key along with the mouse click to select multiple parts or assemblies. This feature tells STRATUS that any part or assembly selected should remain selected until a non-object like canvas white space is selected.

**Viewers:** Available in all viewers (Models, Packages, and Assemblies).

To use the **Multiple Part Selection** feature, under the Settings icon:

1.  Click the **Click to Change Settings** gear icon.
    
2.  Click the **Multiple Part Selection** checkbox.
    
3.  Click either a part or space on the canvas and the sub-menu will disappear.
    
4.  Click multiple parts and they will all be selected.
    
5.  Or, click the first part, the last part, and then the **Select Connected** tool to select all parts between the 2 initially selected parts.
    
6.  Once parts or assemblies are selected, Tools like those under **Actions** can be used.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/2011136001/image2022-12-7_14-30-53.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670445054548&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)
    
7.  Click in empty space to clear your part selections.
    

## Assembly Selection

When used in conjunction with the **Tab** key, **the Assembly Selection** toggle actions change, giving users the flexibility to use the Tab key to override either the Select assembly or the Select Part action depending on whether Assembly Selection is checked or not.

**Viewers:** Available only in the Packages Viewer and Models Viewer.

            iii. **Checked Exact Match (Case Sensitive)** \- When checked, the search criteria will only display results when the entire **Match On** value is matched exactly.
            
            1.  In this case, where the search criteria is (Ex. QA), **No search results** match the **Exact Match** search criteria.

3.  **Scan a QR Code using a tablet camera. Note**: The **QR URL** settings must be checked under Match On.
    
    1.  Click the **Scan a QR Code using a tablet camera** button. The **Scan QR Code with Camera or Reader** dialog will display where the camera will be selected.
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/2011136001/image2022-2-7_11-47-32.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670448820247&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=485&height=250)
        
    2.  Point the camera to the QR code until the **Scan Successful** popup message displays in the bottom left corner.
        
    3.  The QR code will display in the search text and in the search results.
        

## Working with Search Results

After search results display:

1.  **Expand/Collapse View Matches**
    
    1.  Items under Packages, Assemblies, and Parts can be expanded by clicking the View # Matches link (Ex. View 7 Matches).
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/2011136001/image2022-2-7_11-49-9.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670448820352&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=300&height=283)
        
    2.  Click the **Collapse** button ( left of the Assemblies heading) to return to displaying the list Packages, Assemblies, and Parts subset.
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/2011136001/image2022-2-7_11-50-9.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670448820452&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=309&height=250)
        
2.  **Zoom on selection(s)**
    
    1.  Select one or more items in the search results.
        
    2.  Click the **Zoom** button to zoom in on the selected Packages, Assemblies, and Parts in the viewer. Zoom results depend on where these items are located in the model.
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/2011136001/image2022-2-7_11-51-10.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670448820534&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=750&height=422)
        
3.  **Search Results Outside the Current Packages / Assemblies Viewer** \- Since the search searches the model, parts, assemblies, and packages outside the current Packages or Assemblies Viewer will display in the search results annotated with an icon to distinguish it in the list.
    
    1.  Currently, Package 123-FP-ROOF-0003 is open in the viewer.
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/2011136001/image2022-2-7_11-51-55.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670448820617&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1000&height=435)
        
    2.  In this example, the search for 38358-FP-0003 is a different package name.
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/2011136001/image2022-2-7_11-52-39.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670448820702&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1000&height=421)
        
    3.  Click package 38358-FP-0003 in the search results and it will display highlighted in the current viewer. This shows package 38358-FP-0003 in relation to the currently opened package.
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/2011136001/image2022-2-7_11-53-16.png?version=1&modificationDate=1670448820849&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1000&height=441)
        
    4.  Click anywhere else in the model or unselect package 38358-FP-0003 and it will no longer display.

## Create a Report

For information on how to create a Report, see the [**Report (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/200998967 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/200998967") article. For the report to be available in the:

## Packages Viewer Notes

For a Report to display in the Packages > Viewer > Stratus Sheet > Reports drop-down, the report must include the following:

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/0b4b7896-def9-499d-be4a-a51d8702b807)

-   **Format** = PDF
    
-   **Item Type** = Package Details 
    
-   **Template** = Any template 
    
-   **Package Viewer** = Checked
    
-   **Report Fields** = Valid report fields
    

**To display the report in the Packages > Viewer > Stratus Sheet:**

1.  In the Stratus Sheet tab, select the Report and the **Stratus Sheet** will generate using the report.
    

## Assemblies Viewer Notes

For a Report to display in the Assemblies > Viewer > Parts > Reports drop-down, the report must include the following:

![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/217c5a5f-aa54-4e69-95ea-bd06b5f3849b)

-   **Format** = PDF
    
-   **Item Type** = Part 
    
-   **Template** = Any template 
    
-   **Assembly Viewer** = Checked
    
-   **Report Fields** = Valid report fields
    

**To display the report in the Assemblies > Viewer > Parts tab:**

1.  Select the Report in the **Parts** tab and then click the **Stratus Sheet** tab to generate the Stratus Sheet using the report.
    

## Default Assembly Report

When the Assemblies > Viewer loads an assembly for the first time, there are 2 methods that can be used to select the default part report. Method 1 requires that the assembly be within a package. Method 2 has been in Stratus for a long time and can still be used. 

**Note**: Using either method, if a different report is selected after the assembly loads for the first, the system will select that same report the next time you view that particular assembly.

### Method 1 - Packages > Categories > Default Assembly Report

**Default Assembly Report**  - Under Admin > Company > Package Categories, the **Default Assembly Report** option enables administrators to select a default Parts report when loading an assembly for the first time in the Assemblies > Viewer. The selected report is associated with a specific Package Category. Therefore the default report will only apply to assemblies included in packages within the Package Category.

See the [**Default Assembly Report**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351/Package+Categories+Admin#DefaultAssemblyReport "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351/Package+Categories+Admin#DefaultAssemblyReport") article for more information. 

This method was added to Stratus in v6.3.1.

### Method 2 - Report > Assemblies Filter

**Assembly Filter** - Under Admin > Company > Reports, an Assembly Filter can be set to select a default Parts report when loading an assembly for the first time in the Assemblies > Viewer. When the assembly loads, the selected Assembly Filter will compare the parts in the assembly with the Assembly Filter for each relevant Report. The Assembly Filter that matches the most parts will be selected as the default Report.

This was the only method to select a default report until v6.3.1.

The ability to move and hide Tags and update Dimension labels is the same for Stratus Sheets in Packages and Assemblies. The orientation set by the View can also be overridden.

To move or hide tags/dimension labels in the Stratus Sheet:

1.  If neither the **Dimensioning** or **Display - Item Numbers** tool is turned on in the 3D viewer:
    
    1.  Neither Dimension or Item Numbers will display in the 3D Viewer.  
        **Note**: In the example below, the Stratus Sheet Report > Template > View Style settings for **Render Dimensions** and **Render Item Numbers** is checked, therefore, these display in the Stratus Sheet but are not editable.  See the [**View Styles (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8749081 "https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/8749081") article for more information.
        
    2.  Click the **Adjust view orientation and annotation** button.  
        
    3.  Neither Dimension or Item Numbers will will be editable in the Stratus Sheet.
        
    4.  Notice the orientation can be changed using the cube or a click/drag with the mouse.
        
2.  When either **Dimensioning** and **Display - Item Numbers** tools are turned on in the 3D Viewer:
    
    1.  Either Dimensions, Item Numbers, or both, like in the example below, will display in the 3D Viewer.
        
    2.  Click the **Adjust view orientation and annotation** button.  
        
    3.  Either Dimensions, Item Numbers, or both, like in the example below, will be editable in the Stratus Sheet.
        
    4.  Notice the orientation can be changed using the cube or a click/drag with the mouse.
        
3.  To Move or Hide Stratus Sheet dimensions and/or Item Numbers, with either **Dimensioning** and **Display - Item Numbers** tools are turned on in the 3D Viewer, click the **Adjust view orientation and annotation** button
    
    ![](blob:https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/e3f65016-9e74-4e78-b9a2-d515332f90db)
    
    . 
4.  The Item Number tags and Dimensioning labels will display. **Hover** over a tag or label and the **Move** and **Hide** buttons display.
    
    1.  **Move** - Note: Moving a dimension or a tag will affect all viewports as well as the 3D viewer. As a result, after moving a dimension, the Cancel button does not move the dimension back to a previous position, rather it is saved.  
        To move the tag/label:
        
        1.  Click the blue move button and let go of the mouse.
            
        2.  Move your mouse toward where you want to place the tag. The tag will disappear as you move your mouse. A leader will display and will follow your mouse.
            
        3.  Click the mouse when you are ready to place the tag. The tag will display.
            
        4.  Click **Save** or **Cancel**. When the viewer refreshes, the dimension is moved in the Stratus Sheet and the 3D viewer.
            
    2.  **Hide** - Click the hide button. The tag will change to be semi-transparent with gray text on the viewport being edited.
        
    3.  Click **Save**. When the viewer refreshes, the dimension is hidden in the Stratus Sheet, but remains visible in the 3D viewer.
        
5.  **Note**: If you try to set the orientation on a view placeholder with all parts filtered out (the assembly will not display if all parts have been filtered out) based on the view style set on the template, you will get a message saying that there is nothing visible to be oriented and the operation will be canceled.

# sPoint.rfa for Revit - STRATUS Knowledge Base - Confluence

> ## Excerpt
> The sPoint .rfa can be loaded into one or more Revit families and enables snap point control of dimensions in STRATUS. Without the sPoint .rfa, STRATUS will detect all of the different points and vertices across all the geometry in your families which is both a performance inhibitor and makes it difficult to pull the correct dimensions.  Use case examples includes the ability to pull dimensions from hanger to hanger, or, from rod to rod, from equipment pad corners, from stubs, and from sleeves. Note: sPoint is not yet available under Packages > Point Exports.

## sPoint Family Summary

The sPoint family is a cube.  The family includes:

1.  **Detail lines** that have visibility settings that are visible in Coarse and Medium views.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/256409602/image2019-8-16_13-57-1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1565981822748&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=353&height=346)
2.  **Outer cube geometry** that is visible in all views but is controlled by a visibility parameter.

3.  **Line work** in the middle includes Cross Visibility and Cube Visibility settings.

## Working with the sPoint.rfa in Revit

1.  Load the sPoint family into a hanger project, for example, and place it where the rod intersects with the face of the strut, or the edge corners, or at the top of the rod.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/256409602/image2019-8-16_14-0-25.png?version=1&modificationDate=1565982026592&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=487&height=650)
2.  In the Family Editor, in Plan view place the point so that it is aligned (AL) to the reference plane and constrained. Now the point will shift when the family dimensions change.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/256409602/image2019-8-16_14-0-50.png?version=1&modificationDate=1565982051921&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=624&height=329)
3.  One key to linking visibility controls for a point where extractions are from deeply nested layers, they have to be made into a **Shared Family** which enables you to run a schedule and extract out the data. So that you can still control the visibility of the point when looking at a project view of the hanger and retain the point origin for the API extraction, set the sPoint Cube Visibility and sPoint Visibility as follows:  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/256409602/image2019-8-16_14-1-38.png?version=1&modificationDate=1565982100195&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=624&height=323)
4.  Load the hanger into the project where you can see all the points.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/256409602/image2019-8-16_14-2-3.png?version=1&modificationDate=1565982124792&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=432&height=447)
5.  In the model, control how points are visible.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/256409602/image2019-8-16_14-2-33.png?version=1&modificationDate=1565982155064&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=624&height=263)

## Publish a Model and Pull sPoint Dimensions 

1.  Publish the model and manually pull the points in a STRATUS Viewer.
