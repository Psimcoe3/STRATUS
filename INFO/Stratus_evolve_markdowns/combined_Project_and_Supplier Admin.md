## Task Definitions and Task Workflows

**[Company-level Task Definitions and Task Workflows](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10518994/Settings+Admin)** can be overridden at the Project-level. Activating Task Definitions at the Project-level is recommended for testing your definitions.

See the [**Task Definitions**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/217711302/Task+Definitions+Admin) (recommended) article for more information.

See the [**Task Workflows**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/240713729/Task+Workflows+Admin) (not recommended) article for more information.

![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/217907482/image2023-1-13_13-25-52.png?version=1&modificationDate=1673637953608&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

## Duration Days Project Level Configuration

The Project level Package Category Duration Days feature offers calculated initial Start Dates for package phases that override **[Duration Days Company Level Configuration](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/166199351/Package+Categories+Admin#PackageCategories(Admin)-DurationDays)**. Initial Start Dates can be edited at the package level.  
![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/217907482/image2023-6-23_11-23-40.png?version=1&modificationDate=1687537421918&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)

To configure Duration Days for a package category:

1.  **Override Company Options For This Project -** To enable the project override dialog, check **Override Company Options For This Project** option. When checked, this Project option will override Company settings made under **Admin > Company** \> **Package Categories**.
    
2.  At the Project level under Admin > Projects > Settings, the Duration Days (M-F) section displays.  
    1.  **Note**: Company level Duration settings will display in light gray (Ex Rack Hange Rods).
    2.  **Phases** - A Duration Day can be set for each Phase and for each Package Category. Phases are also used in [**Division (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103317524 "/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/103317524") and [**Tracking Statuses (Admin)**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/10485761/Tracking+Statuses+Admin). 
        
        1.  **Office** \- Detailing Start Date
            
        2.  **Purchasing** \- Purchasing Start Date
            
        3.  **Shop** \- Fabrication Start Date
            
        4.  **Field** - Field Date
            
    3.  **Duration Day** - A Duration day is a business day Monday thru Friday. In the current calculation, weekends are excluded while public holidays are included as a business day. For example, if a Start Date for Purchasing Phase is 9/1/2021 and the Duration Day is set to 21, the Start Date for the Shop Phase will be 9/29/2021 where 4 Saturdays and 4 Sundays were excluded, and the public holiday 9/6/2021 was not excluded.
        
3.  Edit the value associated with the phase. **Note**: When a day has been updated, the Package Category will highlight, showing there has been a change (Ex. 250).
    1.  The Confirm Save dialog will display when editing Duration Days at the company and project level. After updating a Package Category > Duration Day:
        
        1.  Click the **Save** button.
        2.  The **Confirm Save** modal will display.![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/217907482/image2023-6-23_11-28-46.png?version=1&modificationDate=1687537727957&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)  
            1.  **Apply to Existing Packages w/o Duration Days**
                
                1.  This option will recalculate package durations that have at least one “Empty” start/end phase date for the specific Package Category/Planning Phase.
                    
                2.  **Note**: For this to trigger and recalculate, their must be at least one start date in the planning phase of the package.
                    
                    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/217907482/image2023-6-23_11-20-23.png?version=1&modificationDate=1687537762471&cacheVersion=1&api=v2) 
                    
            2.  **Apply to All Existing Packages**
                
                1.  This option will recalculate **ALL** existing package durations across the project that have duration days.
                    
            3.  **Do Not Apply to Existing Packages**
                
                1.  This option will not recalculate any package durations within the project.
                    
        3.  Select an option and **Save**.
4.  For the Duration Day to be applied to a package during the create package process:
    1.  **Package Category (required) -** The package category that includes Duration Days for one or more phases must be selected.
    2.  **Phase (optional)** - Phase defaults to **On Site**, but can be changed to a particular Phase. Selecting a phase will only denote which Start Date will be set with the Start Date entered (below). Initial Start Dates will populate the other Phases based on the Duration Days calculations.
    3.  **Start Date (optional)** - The Start Date is used to set the Start Date of the selected Phase.  If a Start Date is not entered, all Phase Start Dates will be empty.
        1.  The meaning of **On Site** is defined by your company.
        2.  On the Packages > Dashboard, the **Required Date = On Site** date.
    4.  **Note: Duration** - If the Package Category selected includes Duration (days), then those Phase Start Dates will be calculated based on the Start Date of the selected Phase (#2).
5.  **Reset** - Click the Reset blue button in the upper right to set all the data back to Company Settings.
6.  See the Package [**Planning / Actual**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/260603982/Package+Properties#PackageProperties-PackagePlanning%2FActual) article for more information.

### Example: Project level Settings

Any Duration Day change at the Project level overrides the existing Company level setting for the edited Package Category and Phase.

**To set Duration Days for a Package Category in a project:**

1.  Click the value to change within the table and enter the number of Duration Days for any Package Category. In this example, for the Fabrication Release Package Category, 3, 5, 7, and 9 were entered for Office, Purchasing, Shop, and Field package Phases.  
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/217907482/image2022-5-19_14-42-12.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652989333917&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=600&height=340)
    
2.  Click **Save**.
    
3.  For a new package:
    
    1.  **Category** \= Rack Hanger Rods
        
    2.  **Phase** \= Shop
        
    3.  **Required Date** = 06/28/2022 
        
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/217907482/image2022-5-19_14-45-52.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652989553699&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=350&height=591)
        
4.  The resulting **Required Date** (07/01/2022 ) displays on the Packages Dashboard.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/217907482/image2022-5-19_14-49-9.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652989750610&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1262&height=250)
    
5.  The Packages > Properties > Planning section will display the Start Dates for the Package Phases based on the Company level Duration Days settings.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/217907482/image2022-5-19_14-50-28.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652989829755&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=860&height=250)
    
    1.  **Office (Start Date)**\- Calculated to be 06/23/2022, 2 Duration Days before the Purchasing Start Date.
        
    2.  **Purchasing** \- Calculated to be 06/27/2021, 4 Duration Days before the Shop Start Date.
        
    3.  **Shop** \- The Package was created with the Shop Phase selected, therefore, the Required Date (07/01/2022) was used as the Shop Start Date. All other initial calculations were based off this start date.
        
    4.  **On Site** - The On Site date is initially set to be 1 Duration day after the Shop End Date.
    5.  **Field** \- Calculated to be 07/12/2022, 8 Duration Days after the On Site End Date.
        
    6.  **Duration (days)** \- The Package Duration is calculated from the Office Start Date to Field End Date which is 21 business days.
        
6.  **Packages > Schedule** - The Start Date for each phase will display as a row on the Packages > Schedule. See the [**Packages Schedule**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/9044061/Packages+Schedule) article for more information.
    
    ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/217907482/image2022-5-19_14-59-18.png?version=1&modificationDate=1652990360096&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1200&height=293)
    
    1.  Hover over any phase to display information. Notice the Duration of 8 days corresponds with the Company level Package Category (Mechanical Piping) and its Shop Lead Days setting of 8 days.  
        ![](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/download/thumbnails/217907482/image2021-8-9_8-54-18.png?version=1&modificationDate=1628517260450&cacheVersion=1&api=v2&width=1000&height=334)
        
    2.  In this example where only Company level Package Category Duration Days are set, any change to a Start Date, End Date, or Duration is considered a Package level override. See either the [**Package Level Configuration**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/260603982/Package+Properties#PackageProperties-PackagePlanning%2FActual) section or the [**Packages Schedule**](https://gtpservices.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SK/pages/9044061/Packages+Schedule) article for more information.
