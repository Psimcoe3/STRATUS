# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public property Static member | [CircleMultiPlanarShape](ad509efd-ac26-dc5d-54cd-1cb1c28d69ac.htm) | A circle can't be converted to multiplanar shape. |
| Public property Static member | [CircleUnbounded](d3eeab1b-3e4a-7973-5f2f-ac31e9d1045c.htm) | An unbounded circle can only be used to construct a spiral shape. |
| Public property Static member | [CurveOverconstrained](e83009e5-91d5-49d8-cbdc-c5fbbf45df4a.htm) | Segment is overconstrained. It has at least one parameterized dimension that conflicts with another dimension. |
| Public property Static member | [CurvesCollinear](6f433812-1259-e5ba-1f8c-3556f24e2109.htm) | Collinear segments are not allowed in a Rebar Shape definition. |
| Public property Static member | [CurvesUnlooped](d700b4dc-2bc1-beb4-fa23-ea9bf05518e0.htm) | Segments defining the Rebar Shape must be in a continuous loop. |
| Public property Static member | [CurveUnderconstrained](f1b3d8d6-8d52-bac2-bc0a-cfa6463a3ae0.htm) | Segment is underconstrained. It requires additional parameterized dimensions. |
| Public property Static member | [DefaultParamaterValuesIncorrect](3ca04b0b-1f42-6ad2-5bcd-af1c1dd5e58f.htm) | Default parameters have incorrect values. One reason for failure might be an edge length that is too short (it's smaller than bent radius). |

| Public property Static member | [DiagonalEdgesAreUnderconstrained](1d84e275-3faf-2ead-358b-bb9d21a7521d.htm) | Shape is underconstrained. Please add additional dimension constraints to the shape's diagonal edges. (Diagonal segments with only one dimension constraint are automatically given a second constraint to lie at an angle of exactly 45 degrees, regardless of how they are drawn. The current shape has more than one such segment in sequence, and the resulting constrained edges are co-linear.) |
| Public property Static member | [DimensionLoose](15fedc66-dd33-375f-0ca9-a957fee2847a.htm) | This dimension cannot be used to parameterize the Rebar Shape. |

| Public property Static member | [DimensionWithoutParameter](d36c8b49-6741-c36f-7b50-90e212a35638.htm) | Dimension has no parameter assigned to it. |
| Public property Static member | [FormulaDrivenDimension](af3c3dc4-6100-2a35-0e00-47c6185650f3.htm) | Dimension can't be driven by a formula parameter. |

| Public property Static member | [ParameterValueNotDefined](f88641af-047c-6969-6283-b3b9528937e0.htm) | Parameter assigned to the dimension has no value defined. |
| Public property Static member | [PlanarMultiPlanarShape](5ceb005d-c8a9-045a-00bf-b9ef3059a78a.htm) | The current shape is only bent in a single plane. A multi-planar definition is not required. Please redefine the shape on the top plane only. |
| Public property Static member | [ShapeFailure](4d3eba00-9c8b-cd0d-c33b-3ae2145d1eda.htm) | The displayed Rebar Shape is created using a 'Rebar Bar for Preview'. This bar defines the bend radius displayed in the family. Using this preview bar the drawn shape cannot be completed. |
| Public property Static member | [WrongDepthDimensionLabel](6d8b67fa-22eb-2674-3bc8-9eda54a43b8d.htm) | Multi-planar depth dimension label is already used for one of the planar shape parameters. |

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public property Static member | [BoundaryDetectError](8c8c3bba-c6e1-d8ee-6738-d87fc72f527d.htm) | A boundary on this surface could not be autodetected. Revit will impose one, but it may be larger than you want. |
| Public property Static member | [ContoursNoncontours](cf2149e8-42af-69b5-8e41-1aef52548631.htm) | The layers you have selected contain both contour lines and non-contour lines (lines of non-constant elevation). You may want to go back and select fewer layers, or you can continue, but the boundary of the site may be larger than you want. |
| Public property Static member | [DifferentEntityTypes](1202ad11-8794-1d55-f063-c42e56caec57.htm) | Can't auto-detect boundary. The layers selected contain data that may make the Toposurface look incorrect. For better results, try selecting only those layers that contain relevant 3D info. |
| Public property Static member | [NoPoints](7bbef7e2-44ac-abf4-51f0-4084369adeae.htm) | No points were found in the file. |

| Public property Static member | [SurfaceExists](3e47440a-9d7f-5ca8-4773-3851d8efa999.htm) | You are importing data into a surface that already contains points. You may want to go back, create a new surface, and import the data into that instead. You can continue, and Revit will sew the meshes together, but the boundary may be larger than you want. |
| Public property Static member | [TooFarAway](bd99be6a-646b-59c3-c69b-75f8b4d0b34a.htm) | Imported Toposurface Points are located a large distance from the model and might not display properly. Points will be centered on the model instead. |
| Public property Static member | [TooLarge](c991d035-dd20-aeb4-c500-7f10ca5bfc8f.htm) | There are too many points on the selected layers of this dataset to place into the toposurface. Try selecting fewer layers to create the surface |
| Public property Static member | [TooManyMeshes](0f1d4267-f6b9-56a1-c4ee-cf1489e335cb.htm) | The layers you have selected contain more than one mesh. You may want to go back and import the meshes separately. If you continue, the meshes will be combined and a new boundary will be created. |
| Public property Static member | [UnusedPoints](7ddd17c9-1d02-c172-ea56-b684505abe0a.htm) | Some rows from the file could not be used. |
