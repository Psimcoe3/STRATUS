(Inherited from  Object  .)Public method	GetType	Gets the  Type  of the current instance. (Inherited from  Object  .)Public method	ScaleToBox	Move and resize the bar to fit within a specified box. The arguments are interpreted as an arbitrary rectangle in 3D with vertices: origin, origin+xVec, origin+xVec+yVec, origin+yVec. The algorithm then proceeds as follows. First the bar is given the default values of the shape parameters from the shape definition. Then, if it is possible to do so without violating the shape definition, the parameter values are scaled so that the width and height of the shape (including bar thickness) match the lengths of xVec and yVec. If there is no way to do this within the shape definition due to overconstraining, a compromise is attempted, such as scaling the whole shape until either the width or the height is correct. Finally the shape is rotated to match the coordinate system of the box. The algorithm is the same one used in one-click placement.Public method	ScaleToBoxFor3D	Move and resize a spiral or multiplanar instance to fit within a specified box. The arguments are interpreted as an arbitrary rectangle in 3D with vertices: origin, origin+xVec, origin+xVec+yVec, origin+yVec. One end of the rebar shape is inscribed in this rectangle following the procedure described for the ScaleToBox method. The other end is placed in the parallel plane at distance (center-to-center) given by the height argument, in the direction of (xVec x yVec). Note that spiral shapes interpret the input arguments using a different convention than multiplanar shapes. For spiral shapes, the spiral start will be placed in the rectangle defined by origin, xVec, yVec, and the end of the spiral will be placed in the parallel plane. For multiplanar shapes, the rebar is placed with its primary shape definition located in the parallel plane defined by the height argument, and its connector segments extending in the direction opposite (xVec x yVec). This method replaces ScaleToBoxForSpiral() from prior releases.Public method	SetLayoutAsFixedNumber	Sets the Layout Rule property of rebar set to FixedNumber.Public method	SetLayoutAsMaximumSpacing	Sets the Layout Rule property of rebar set to MaximumSpacingPublic method	SetLayoutAsMinimumClearSpacing	Sets the Layout Rule property of rebar set to MinimumClearSpacingPublic method	SetLayoutAsNumberWithSpacing	Sets the Layout Rule property of rebar set to NumberWithSpacingPublic method	SetLayoutAsSingle	Sets the Layout Rule property of rebar set to Single.Public method	SetRebarShapeId	Changes the RebarShape element that defines the shape of the rebar. Changing the value of this member causes the Rebar instance to choose values for its shape parameters to preserve its previous shape as closely as possiblePublic method	ToString	Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from  Object  .)Properties	Name	DescriptionPublic property	ArrayLength	Identifies the distribution path length of rebar set.Public property	BarsOnNormalSide	Identifies if the bars of the rebar set are on the same side of the rebar plane indicated by the normal.Public property	BaseFinishingTurns	For a spiral, the number of finishing turns at the lower end of the spiral.Public property	Height	For a spiral, the overall height.Public property	IsValidObject	Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity.Public property	MultiplanarDepth	For a multiplanar rebar, the depth of the instance.Public property	Normal	A unit-length vector normal to the plane of the rebarPublic property	Pitch	For a spiral, the pitch, or vertical distance traveled in one rotation.Public property	TopFinishingTurns	For a spiral, the number of finishing turns at the upper end of the spiral.See AlsoRebarShapeDrivenAccessor ClassAutodesk.Revit.DB.Structure Namespace<!-- Start of Methods__f81dae71-9830-6ee9-d6a8-4125261a0637.md -->✨ Located in SF Bay Area or LA?
