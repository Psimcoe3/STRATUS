# Help | What You Will Need to Get Started | Autodesk

> ## Excerpt
> A working understanding of Autodesk Revit.

---
1.  A working understanding of Autodesk Revit.
    
2.  An installation of an Autodesk Revit-based product, including the Software Development Kit.
    
3.  MS Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (C# or VB.NET). Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Professional is recommended, though, as Community editions do not support DLL debugging. Alternatively, you can use the built-in SharpDevelop development environment in Revit.
    
4.  Some experience in a .NET based development language. (Autodesk Revit API examples are provided in C# and Visual Basic.NET.)

# Help | Installation | Autodesk

> ## Excerpt
> The Autodesk Revit API is automatically installed with the default installation of the Autodesk Revit based product. Any .NET based application will reference the RevitAPI.dll and the RevitAPIUI.dll located in the Revit Program directory. The RevitAPI.dll contains methods used to access Revit's application, documents, elements and parameters at the database level. The RevitAPIUI.dll contains the interfaces related to manipulation and customization of the Revit user interface.

The Autodesk Revit API is automatically installed with the default installation of the Autodesk Revit based product. Any .NET based application will reference the RevitAPI.dll and the RevitAPIUI.dll located in the Revit Program directory. The RevitAPI.dll contains methods used to access Revit's application, documents, elements and parameters at the database level. The RevitAPIUI.dll contains the interfaces related to manipulation and customization of the Revit user interface.

Note that additional API functionality exists in RevitAPIIFC.dll, RevitAPIMacros.dll, and RevitAPIUIMacros.dll, which also install with Revit, but these assemblies are not immediately required to get started.

The Autodesk Revit API Software Development Kit (SDK) is installed from the Tools and Utilities section of the Autodesk Revit installation.

# Help | Development Requirements | Autodesk

> ## Excerpt
> The Autodesk Revit API requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8.

---
The Autodesk Revit API requires the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8.

To edit and debug your API applications, you need an interactive development environment such as Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Professional or MS Visual Studio Community for C# or Visual Basic.NET. (Visual Studio Professional is recommended, as Express editions do not support DLL debugging.) When developing with the Autodesk Revit API, ensure that your project references two DLLs: **RevitAPI.dll** and **RevitAPIUI.dll** contained in the Autodesk Revit Program directory.

Some programming skills are required to effectively use the API. If you are a beginner in programming, we strongly advise you to learn Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and one of the compatible languages like C# or Visual Basic.NET. There are many good books and classes to get you started.

# Help | Documentation Conventions | Autodesk

> ## Excerpt
> This document contains class names in namespace format, such as Autodesk.Revit.DB.Element. In C++/CLI Autodesk.Revit.Element is Autodesk::Revit::DB::Element. Since only C# is used for sample code in this manual, the default namespace is Autodesk.Revit.DB. If you want to see code in Visual Basic, you will find several VB.NET applications in the SDK Samples directory.

If you want to see code in Visual Basic, you will find several VB.NET applications in the SDK Samples directory.

### Indexed Properties

Some Revit Platform API class properties are "indexed", or described as overloaded in the API help file (RevitAPI.chm). For example, the Element.Geometry property. In the text of this document, these are referred to as properties, although you access them as if they were methods in C# code by pre-pending the property name with "get\_" or "set\_". For example, to use the Element.Geometry(Options) property, you use Element.get\_Geometry(Options).
