# Help | Point Clouds | Autodesk

> ## Excerpt
> The Revit API provides 2 ways to work with point clouds. The first way allows you to create new point cloud instances, read and filter points, select sub-sets of the overall points, and select points to be highlighted or isolated. The second way allows you to use your own point cloud engine and process unsupported file formats (i.e. other than .pcg, .rcp or .rcs), providing points to Revit for the user to see.
