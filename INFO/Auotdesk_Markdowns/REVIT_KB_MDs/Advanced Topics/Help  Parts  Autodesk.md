Parts can be generated from elements with layered structures, such as:

-   Walls (excluding stacked walls and curtain walls)
-   Floors (excluding shape-edited floors)
-   Roofs (excluding those with ridge lines)
-   Ceilings
-   Structural slab foundations

In the Revit API, elements can be divided into parts using the PartUtils class. The static method PartUtils.CreateParts() is used to create parts from one or more elements. Note that this method instantiates a PartMaker and creates Parts that will be split in smaller parts if you chose to use DivideParts. The PartMaker uses its embedded rules to drive creation of the needed parts during regeneration.

The API also offers an interface to subdivide parts. PartUtils.DivideParts() accepts as input a collection of part ids, a collection of “intersecting element” ids (which can be layers and grids), and a collection of curves. The routine uses the intersecting elements and curves as boundaries from which to divide and generate new parts.

The GetAssociatedParts() method can be called to find some or all of the parts associated with an element, or use HasAssociatedParts() to determine if an element has parts.

You can delete parts through the API either by deleting the individual part elements, or by deleting the PartMaker associated to the parts (which will delete all parts generated by this PartMaker after the next regeneration).

Parts can be manipulated in the Revit API much the same as they can in the Revit user interface. For example, the outer boundaries of parts may be offset with PartUtils.SetFaceOffset().

The following example offsets all the faces of a part that can be offset.

**Before and After Offseting faces of a selected Part**

## Returning the entities that create a divided Part

These methods identify and return the curves that were sketched to create the part division and, optionally, also outputs also the sketch plane for those curves.

-   PartUtils.GetSplittingCurves(Document, ElementId)
-   PartUtils.GetSplittingCurves(Document, ElementId, out SketchPlane)

`PartUtils.GetSplittingElements(Document, ElementId)`identifies and returns the elements ( ReferencePlane, Level or Grid ) that were used to create the division.

## Parts and Direct Shapes

Parts can be created from DirectShape instances, either in the same host document or in a link. These methods indicate whether it is possible to create parts from an instance of one of those classes.

-   DirectShape.CanCreateParts()
-   DirectShapeType.CanCreateParts()
