The following sections describe API features that only pertain to the structural engineering features of Revit:

-   Structural Model Elements - Discusses specific Elements and their properties that only relate to the structural engineering features of Revit.
-   AnalyticalModel - Discusses analytical model-related classes such as AnalyticalModel, RigidLink, and AnalyticalModelSupport.
-   AnalyticalLink - Discusses creating new analytical links between analytical beams and columns.
-   Loads - Discusses Load Settings and three kinds of Loads.
-   Your Analysis Link - Provides suggestions for API users who want to link Revit to certain Structural Analysis applications.

This chapter contains some advanced topics. If you are not familiar with the Revit Platform API, read the basic sections first, such as [Getting Started](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2023/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_Getting_Started_html), [Elements Essentials](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2023/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_Elements_Essentials_html), [Parameters](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2023/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Basic_Interaction_with_Revit_Elements_Parameters_html), and so on.
