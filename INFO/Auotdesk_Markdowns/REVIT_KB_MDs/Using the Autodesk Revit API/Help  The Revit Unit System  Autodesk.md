The Revit Unit System uses the following base units:

| **Base Unit** | **Unit in Revit** | **Unit System** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Length | Feet (ft) | Imperial |
| Angle | Radian | Metric |
| Mass | Kilogram (kg) | Metric |
| Time | Seconds (s) | Metric |
| Electric Current | Ampere (A) | Metric |
| Temperature | Kelvin (K) | Metric |
| Luminous Intensity | Candela (cd) | Metric |

**Note:** Because Revit stores lengths in feet and other quantities in metric, a derived unit involving length uses a non-standard unit using the Imperial and the Metric systems. For example, force is measured in mass-length per time squared and is stored in kg-ft/s<sup id="GUID-078A40F7-993B-409A-B450-1D3CC548CDED__GUID-DF42C96E-BC65-469A-9980-4A1C0AD20DF2">2</sup>
