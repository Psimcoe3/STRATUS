This event is cancellable, except when it is raised as part of application closing. Check the 'Cancellable' property of event's argument to see whether it is cancellable or not. When it is cancellable, call the 'Cancel()' method of event's argument to True to cancel it. Your application is responsible for providing feedback to the user about the reason for the cancellation.
