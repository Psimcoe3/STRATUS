# Remarks

Topology of a polymesh consists of a number of points and triangular facets formed by the points. Each facet is determined by three indices to the array of points. A polymesh may have UV coordinates assigned, and always has at least one normal associated. There may be more than one normal available for a non-planar polymesh; there may be as many normals as there are either facets or points in the polymesh. The DistributionOfNormals property indicates how normals are distributed along the polymesh.
