# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [AddBarGeometry(IList Curve )](670a749b-0189-50dd-a019-1f7c876aef2f.htm) | Adds a new bar to the new rebar geometry. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| Public method | [AddBarGeometry(CurveLoop)](86eac3b9-d2af-68c8-bdba-f8e8c8d79624.htm) | Adds a new bar to the new rebar geometry. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| Public method | [CanAddBarGeometry](a7ffdbd4-6702-2c77-eedc-bf03e60663c0.htm) | If the layout rule is Singe or FixedNumber or NumberWithSpacing this function will return true if getNumberOfBarGeometry() is less getBarsNumber(), false otherwise.  If the layout rule is MaximumSpacing or MinimumClearSpacing this function will return always true. |
| Public method | [ClearAllAddedBarGeometry](9d7a1671-2d14-5dc7-b488-b597e8318e5d.htm) | This function will remove all bars geometry that were added by calling AddBarGeometry(). |
| Public method | [Dispose](58cb8d3e-f37d-aa90-bb86-7faec1c4e638.htm) | Releases all resources used by the  [RebarCurvesData](71996f44-c8f9-7695-ccb9-efae09726c9c.htm) |
| Public method | [Equals](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bsc2ak47) | Determines whether the specified  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  is equal to the current  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  . (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
| Public method | [GetAddedBarGeometry](c9c202d7-a7b6-32f7-440e-db2377853754.htm) | Gets the added curves that will represent the bar at index barIndex. |
| Public method | [GetDistributionPath](5067a5af-283a-032f-1724-b2bf1c8628c9.htm) | Gets the distribution path currently stored in the rebar. |
| Public method | [GetHashCode](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zdee4b3y) | Serves as a hash function for a particular type. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
| Public method | [GetNumberOfBarGeometry](cd4e016b-6301-31f7-6c37-660a35a6b688.htm) | Gets the number of Bar Geometry that were added. |
| Public method | [GetRebarUpdateCurvesData](89fe31e2-42bb-7a25-caa3-6254b0105173.htm) | Gets a class that contains information used as input and output for rebar free form calculation. |
| Public method | [GetType](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dfwy45w9) | Gets the  [Type](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/42892f65)  of the current instance. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
| Public method | [SetDistributionPath](7d542d46-cedc-9a45-bb83-47be487640cf.htm) | Sets a new distribution path to be applied to the rebar. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| Public method | [ToString](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7bxwbwt2) | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
