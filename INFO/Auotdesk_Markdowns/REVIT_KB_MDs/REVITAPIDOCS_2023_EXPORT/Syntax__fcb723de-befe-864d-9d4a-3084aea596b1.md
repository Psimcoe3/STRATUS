Creates a new point cloud filter based upon planar boundaries.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds](5974062a-47d4-c7bb-16f2-d5dd193bd170.htm)

  **Since:**  2012

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static PointCloudFilter CreateMultiPlaneFilter( 	IList<Plane> planes ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateMultiPlaneFilter ( _ 	planes As IList(Of Plane) _ ) As PointCloudFilter ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static PointCloudFilter^ CreateMultiPlaneFilter( 	IList<Plane^>^ planes ) ``` |

#### Parameters

planes
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [Plane](6a6ee978-f114-558d-3c69-00d289aa855f.htm)    
     All planes used for filtering; positive direction of the normal should point inside the volume of interest. Only points on the "positive" side of all planes will pass the filter.

#### Return Value

Filter object; can be used to get representative set of cloud points passing through the filter.

# Remarks

The filter will check whether a point is located on the "positive" side of each plane, as indicated by the positive direction of the plane normal. Therefore, such filter implicitly defines a volume, which is the intersection of the positive half-spaces corresponding to all the planes. This volume does not have to be closed, but it will always be convex.
