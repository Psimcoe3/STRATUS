| [SpatialElementBoundarySubface Class](0a8f3677-3320-a8a5-674e-b0d055ac6671.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Returns a face that represents the portion of the room face bounded by the boundary element.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2012

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public Face GetSubface() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetSubface As Face ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: Face^ GetSubface() ``` |

#### Return Value

The sub-face.

# Remarks

If the spatial element's face is adjacent to multiple bounding elements (such as two different walls), there will be one sub-face for each portion of the spatial element's face where it is adjacent to one of those room-bounding elements. This is equivalent to the return of GetRoomFace() if the entire room face is created by the boundary element.
