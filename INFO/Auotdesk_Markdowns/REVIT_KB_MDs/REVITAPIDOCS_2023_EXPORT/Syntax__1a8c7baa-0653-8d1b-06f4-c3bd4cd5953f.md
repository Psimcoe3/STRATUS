# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double GetDistance( 	double fromStation, 	double toStation ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetDistance ( _ 	fromStation As Double, _ 	toStation As Double _ ) As Double ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: double GetDistance( 	double fromStation,  	double toStation ) ``` |

#### Parameters

fromStation
:   Type:  System Double    
     The displayed alignment station from which 2D length is to be calculated, in Revit internal model units (standard Imperial feet).

toStation
:   Type:  System Double    
     The displayed alignment station to which 2D length is to be calculated, in Revit internal model units (standard Imperial feet).

#### Return Value

Distance (positive or negative) along the alignment between two stations. The sign of the distance depends on the relative positions of the input stations on the alignment.
