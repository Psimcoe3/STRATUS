#### Parameters

serverId
:   Type:  [System Guid](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cey1zx63)    
     Id of the application server.

# Remarks

Only one server can be active at any given time in a single-server service, but it is possible that no server is active (unless the service is mandatory).

An application-wide active server gets executed when the service is invoked in the scope of the entire application (i.e. without a specific document), or if the service is executed in a document but the document does not have an active server explicitly set.

It is possible to set a server as active when another server is already active for that service. Making a server active will automatically deactivate the server that was active before this call.
