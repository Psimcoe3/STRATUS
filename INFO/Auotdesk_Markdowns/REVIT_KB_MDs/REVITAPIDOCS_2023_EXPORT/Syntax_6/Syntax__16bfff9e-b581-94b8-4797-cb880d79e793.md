Builds a mesh by extruding curve loop(s) along extrusion distance.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static MeshFromGeometryOperationResult CreateMeshByExtrusion( 	IList<CurveLoop> profileLoops, 	XYZ extrusionDirection, 	double extrusionDistance, 	ElementId materialId ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateMeshByExtrusion ( _ 	profileLoops As IList(Of CurveLoop), _ 	extrusionDirection As XYZ, _ 	extrusionDistance As Double, _ 	materialId As ElementId _ ) As MeshFromGeometryOperationResult ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static MeshFromGeometryOperationResult^ CreateMeshByExtrusion( 	IList<CurveLoop^>^ profileLoops,  	XYZ^ extrusionDirection,  	double extrusionDistance,  	ElementId^ materialId ) ``` |

#### Parameters

profileLoops
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)    
     The profile loops to be extruded. The loops will not be modified.

extrusionDirection
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     Direction of extrusion. The length of this vector is ignored.

extrusionDistance
:   Type:  System Double    
     The positive distance by which the loops are extruded in the direction of the input extrusionDir.

materialId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     Material which should be used by a constructed mesh.

#### Return Value

Returns a mesh, which was constructed, and some additional information.

# Remarks

This function supports creation of a mesh given a collection of continuous curve loops, which are processed independently from each other. Loops with gaps or with curves with wrong flips will be split before processing.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The input value cannot be used as thickness for an extrusion, or blend, or wall layer, or similar geometric construct. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm) | extrusionDirection has zero length. |
