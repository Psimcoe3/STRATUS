# Remarks

Curtain Walls and Curtain Systems are normally exported as several openings, panel by panel, while for energy analysis all you need is one giant window. A curtain wall with 50 panels gets exported as 50 openings, while 1 opening with the total opening area would be more appropriate. When this setting is on, one "large" window/opening will be exported for a curtain wall/system
