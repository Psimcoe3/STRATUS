A connector in an Autodesk Revit MEP project document.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 17.0.0.0 (17.0.1090.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class Connector : IConnector, IDisposable ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class Connector _ 	Implements IConnector, IDisposable ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class Connector : IConnector,  	IDisposable ``` |

# Remarks

This connector is an item that is a part of another element (duct, pipe, fitting, or equipment etc.). This connector does not represent the connector element that can be created inside a family; for that element, refer to  [ConnectorElement](cd7d7579-1058-e8ca-d55a-c3a914843667.htm)  .
