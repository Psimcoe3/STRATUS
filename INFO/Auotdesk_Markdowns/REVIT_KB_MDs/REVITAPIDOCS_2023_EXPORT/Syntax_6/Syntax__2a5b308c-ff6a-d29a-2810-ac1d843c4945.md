Create new Form element by swept blend operation, and add it into the Autodesk Revit family document.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.Creation](ded320da-058a-4edd-0418-0582389559a7.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public Form NewSweptBlendForm( 	bool isSolid, 	ReferenceArray path, 	ReferenceArrayArray profiles ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function NewSweptBlendForm ( _ 	isSolid As Boolean, _ 	path As ReferenceArray, _ 	profiles As ReferenceArrayArray _ ) As Form ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: Form^ NewSweptBlendForm( 	bool isSolid,  	ReferenceArray^ path,  	ReferenceArrayArray^ profiles ) ``` |

#### Parameters

isSolid
:   Type:  [System Boolean](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a28wyd50)    
     Indicates if the Form is Solid or Void.

path
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ReferenceArray](bc9192b5-6666-a8de-0128-87dae479fd6a.htm)    
     The path of the swept blend. The path should be 2D, where all input curves lie in one plane. If there's more than one profile, the path should be a single curve. It's required to reference existing geometry.

profiles
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ReferenceArrayArray](b50edc19-b437-2aab-bd03-5d1a0aed4164.htm)    
     The profile set of the newly created swept blend. Each profile should consist of only one curve loop. Each profile must be in a plane that intersects with the path and is perpendicular to the path at the point of intersection.

#### Return Value

If creation was successful new form is returned.
