| [CompoundStructure Class](dc1a081e-8dab-565f-145d-a429098d353c.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Takes a horizontal slice through a sample wall to which this CompoundStructure is applied and returns a simple compound structure which describes that slice, i.e. a series of parallel layers.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 16.0.0.0 (16.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public CompoundStructure GetSimpleCompoundStructure( 	double wallHeight, 	double distAboveBase ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetSimpleCompoundStructure ( _ 	wallHeight As Double, _ 	distAboveBase As Double _ ) As CompoundStructure ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: CompoundStructure^ GetSimpleCompoundStructure( 	double wallHeight,  	double distAboveBase ) ``` |

#### Parameters

wallHeight
:   Type:  [System Double](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/643eft0t)    
     The height of the wall.

distAboveBase
:   Type:  [System Double](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/643eft0t)    
     The distance from the base of the wall at which to take the section. If distAboveBase < 0, then internally distAboveBase = 0 is used. If distAboveBase > wallHeight, then internally distAboveBase = wallHeight is used.

#### Return Value

A simple CompoundStructure representing a series of parallel layers.

# Remarks

If  [IsVerticallyCompound](cd352f22-8ca4-b3b6-f247-d9865a91bb6f.htm)  is false, the output is a copy of this CompoundStructure.
