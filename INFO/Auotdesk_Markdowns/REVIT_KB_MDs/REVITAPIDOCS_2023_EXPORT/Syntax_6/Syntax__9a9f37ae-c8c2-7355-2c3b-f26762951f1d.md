| [IExportContext Interface](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

This method marks the beginning of a Face to be exported.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 18.0.0.0 (18.2.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` RenderNodeAction OnFaceBegin( 	FaceNode node ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Function OnFaceBegin ( _ 	node As FaceNode _ ) As RenderNodeAction ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` RenderNodeAction OnFaceBegin( 	FaceNode^ node ) ``` |

#### Parameters

node
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FaceNode](fbd0d7af-ac40-e81e-8e06-8b2ce90be28b.htm)    
     An output node that represents a Face.

#### Return Value

Return RenderNodeAction. Proceed if you wish to receive geometry (polymesh) for this face, or return RenderNodeAction.Skip otherwise.

# Remarks

Note that this method (as well as OnFaceEnd) is invoked only if the custom exporter was set up to include geometric objects in the output stream. See  [IncludeGeometricObjects](2ce1075e-380e-01e7-6459-b7467c2a2414.htm)  for mode details.
