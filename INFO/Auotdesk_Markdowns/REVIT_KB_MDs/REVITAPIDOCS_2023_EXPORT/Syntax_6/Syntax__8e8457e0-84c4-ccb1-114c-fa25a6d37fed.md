| BadShellOrder | Layer Function Priorities ascend from the Core Boundary to the Finish Face. |
| CoreTooThin | Core contain a membrane layer or thickness of core is zero. |
| MembraneTooThick | Thickness of membrane layer is more than zero. |
| NonmembraneTooThin | Thickness of non-membrane layer is too thin. |
