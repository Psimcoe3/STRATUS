The location represents a point in the model where the  [ImageInstance](ff77d6c8-a94a-067a-cd95-4f2cd3ec8dcc.htm)  will be placed. The location of the image in the view is determined by the projection of this point onto the plane of the view. This means that in a plan view, for example, the z-coordinate has no effect.
