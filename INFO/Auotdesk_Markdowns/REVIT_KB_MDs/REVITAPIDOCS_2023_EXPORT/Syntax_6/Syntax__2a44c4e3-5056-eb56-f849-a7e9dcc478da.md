| ``` public: static DirectShape^ CreateElementInstance( 	Document^ document,  	ElementId^ typeId,  	ElementId^ categoryId,  	String^ definitionId,  	Transform^ trf ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     Document to which the created element will be added.

typeId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     Element id of a DirectShapeType element.

categoryId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     Id of the category assigned to this DirectShape. Must be a valid category id.

definitionId
:   Type:  System String    
     Id of the shape definition that was created earlier and stored via DirectShapeLibrary.

trf
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Transform](58dd01c8-b3fc-7142-e4f3-c524079a282d.htm)    
     Transform to be applied to the definition.

#### Return Value

The created DirectShape object.

# Remarks

This function is included for convenience. It essentially combines CreateGeometryInstance and CreateElement. The shape stored in the element is either a reference or a copy of a definition shape that was created earlier. How the definitions are stored will determine whether an instance or a copy of the shape will be created. The intended use is to support a definition/instance pattern common in CAD formats - DWG blocks, STEP MAPPED\_ITEM, IFC IfcMappedItem. Use DirectShapeLibrary class to store definitions prior to using them here.

# Exceptions
