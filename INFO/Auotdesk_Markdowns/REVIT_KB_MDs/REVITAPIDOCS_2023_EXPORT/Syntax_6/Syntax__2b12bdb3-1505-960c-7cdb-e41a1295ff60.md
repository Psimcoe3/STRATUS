#### Parameters

callback
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ISaveSharedCoordinatesCallbackForUnloadLocally](021f9320-4a8b-d6a3-2ae3-424e4752c37b.htm)    
     A callback indicating what to do if Revit encounters links which have changes in shared coordinates. The saving options for unloading locally only could be: save the link, not save the link. If    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  , Revit will not save any shared coordinates changes to the link before unloading.

#### Return Value

Returns true if the attempt to unload the link locally was successful.

# Remarks

This function unloads the Revit link for the current user, instead of all users, in the workshared files.

If you want to unload the Revit link for all users, please use  [Unload(ISaveSharedCoordinatesCallback)](83f4add7-1c0a-ddfa-b8ab-5be6df0f28a2.htm)  .

This function should not be called on a Revit link:

* in a document which is in an edit mode or is in family mode.
* in a document which is in dynamic update.
* in a document which is read only.
* in a document in which there is transaction phase left open.
* in a non-workshared file.
* in a central model of workshared file.
* which is nested.
* which is unloaded locally already.
