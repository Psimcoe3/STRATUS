Inserts a new instance of a family into the document, using a location, type/symbol and a base level.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.Creation](ded320da-058a-4edd-0418-0582389559a7.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 16.0.0.0 (16.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public FamilyInstance NewFamilyInstance( 	XYZ location, 	FamilySymbol symbol, 	Level level, 	StructuralType structuralType ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function NewFamilyInstance ( _ 	location As XYZ, _ 	symbol As FamilySymbol, _ 	level As Level, _ 	structuralType As StructuralType _ ) As FamilyInstance ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: FamilyInstance^ NewFamilyInstance( 	XYZ^ location,  	FamilySymbol^ symbol,  	Level^ level,  	StructuralType structuralType ) ``` |

#### Parameters

location
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The physical location where the instance is to be placed.

symbol
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.htm)    
     A FamilySymbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.

level
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Level](577e5d4e-a558-118c-9dea-3b810b061775.htm)    
     A Level object that is used as the base level for the object.

structuralType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure StructuralType](0a0a3793-5fce-283d-4953-a137f5593db9.htm)    
     If structural then specify the type of the component.

#### Return Value

If creation was successful then an instance to the new object is returned, otherwise    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  .

# Remarks

This method is used to add a family instance that doesn't require a host element, but that can be associated to a level. If the instance fails to be created an exception may be thrown.

The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods.

All levels within the document can be found by iterating over the entire document and searching for objects of type Autodesk.Revit.Elements.Level.

Some families, such as Beams, have more than one endpoint and are inserted in the same manner as single point instances. Once inserted these linear family instances can have their endpoints changed by using the instance's Element.Location property.

Note: if the created family instance includes nested instances, the API framework will automatically regenerate the document during this method call.

```
FamilyInstance CreateColumn(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document, Level level)
{
    // Get a Column type from Revit
    FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
    collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol)).OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_StructuralColumns);
    FamilySymbol columnType = collector.FirstElement() as FamilySymbol;

    FamilyInstance instance = null;
    if (null != columnType)
    {
        // Create a column at the origin
        XYZ origin = new XYZ(0, 0, 0);

        instance = document.Create.NewFamilyInstance(origin, columnType, level, StructuralType.Column);
    }

    return instance;
}
```

    Dim columnType As FamilySymbol = TryCast(collector.FirstElement(), FamilySymbol)

    Dim instance As FamilyInstance = Nothing
    If columnType IsNot Nothing Then
        ' Create a column at the origin
        Dim origin As New XYZ(0, 0, 0)

        instance = document.Create.NewFamilyInstance(origin, columnType, level, StructuralType.Column)
