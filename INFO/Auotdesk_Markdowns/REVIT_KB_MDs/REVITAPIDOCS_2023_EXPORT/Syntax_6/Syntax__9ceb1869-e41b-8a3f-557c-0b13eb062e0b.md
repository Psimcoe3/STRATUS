Creates a new room within the confines of a plan circuit, or places an unplaced room within the confines of the plan circuit.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.Creation](ded320da-058a-4edd-0418-0582389559a7.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 17.0.0.0 (17.0.1090.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public Room NewRoom( 	Room room, 	PlanCircuit circuit ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function NewRoom ( _ 	room As Room, _ 	circuit As PlanCircuit _ ) As Room ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: Room^ NewRoom( 	Room^ room,  	PlanCircuit^ circuit ) ``` |

#### Parameters

room
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture Room](75c9d2c7-a402-ea8b-9e7c-f8bc3510bbd5.htm)    
     The room which you want to locate in the circuit. Pass    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  to create a new room.

circuit
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB PlanCircuit](9fdb77cb-c579-1cbd-71de-01f06a18ea3a.htm)    
     The circuit in which you want to locate a room.

#### Return Value

If successful the room is returned, otherwise    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  .

# Remarks

This method will regenerate the document even in manual regeneration mode.
