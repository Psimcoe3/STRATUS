# Remarks

When you reset shared coordinates, the shared coordinates of the host model will be erased. The shared relationship with all the linked models will be eliminated. Survey point will be reset back to startup location, where it coincides with the Internal Origin. The rotation angle between Project North and True North will be reset back to 0.
