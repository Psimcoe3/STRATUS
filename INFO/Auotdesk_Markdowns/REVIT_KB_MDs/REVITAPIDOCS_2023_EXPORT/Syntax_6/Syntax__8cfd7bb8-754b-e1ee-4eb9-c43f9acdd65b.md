# Remarks

Identifies whether the per-view SunAndShadowSettings element shares global settings. Global settings are a special case that allows multiple views to be associated together in order that a change in one view affects that same change in other views. There cannot be multiple such groups, and a SunAndShadowSettings element is either a global setting or not.
