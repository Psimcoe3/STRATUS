Provides location functionality for all elements that have a single insertion point.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class LocationPoint : Location ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class LocationPoint _ 	Inherits Location ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class LocationPoint : public Location ``` |

# Remarks

The location point objects adds additional functionality to its base location object class. This includes setting the elements location to a specific point and retrieving its rotation around its insertion point. Inplace families do not have a single insertion point and therefore do not have meaningful LocationPoint data.
