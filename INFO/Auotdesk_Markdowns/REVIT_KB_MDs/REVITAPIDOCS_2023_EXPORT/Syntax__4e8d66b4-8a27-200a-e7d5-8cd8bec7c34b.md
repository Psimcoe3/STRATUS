# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool IsBarMatchedWithShapeInReverseOrder( 	int barPositionIndex ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function IsBarMatchedWithShapeInReverseOrder ( _ 	barPositionIndex As Integer _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool IsBarMatchedWithShapeInReverseOrder( 	int barPositionIndex ) ``` |

#### Parameters

barPositionIndex
:   Type:  [System Int32](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/td2s409d)    
     An index between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1).

#### Return Value

Returns true if the bar is matched in reversed order with its shape, false otherwise.

# Remarks

If this Rebar has Workshop Instructions set to Straight will return false for all barPositionIndex between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1).

If this Rebar has Workshop Instructions set to Bent there are different cases:

* All bars are matched exactly with a shape. In this case will return false for all barPositionIndex between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1).
* All bars are matched in reversed order with a shape. In this case the Rebar will be reversed and will return false for all barPositionIndex between 0 and (NumberOfBarPositions-1).
* Some bars are matched in reversed order and the others are matched exactly with a shape. For the bars matched in reversed order will return true and for the others will return false
