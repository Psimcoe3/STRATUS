# Remarks

This property is not applicable to all dimensions. For example, it is not available for spot slope dimensions, multi-segments dimensions, dimensions using equality formula, and when dimension style is ordinate.

If the position is not applicable, this property throws InvalidOperationException.

Notes for SpotDimension:

* This property throws InvalidOperationException if dimension has no leader.
* Setting of this property works differently for leader with and without shoulder.
* If leader has shoulder, setting is limited by points on line between leader end and shoulder points (projected point is used).
* Setting of this property also affects TextPosition.
