Derived classes override this method to implement the test that determines whether the two given double-precision values satisfy the desired condition or not.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2011

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool Evaluate( 	double lhs, 	double rhs, 	double epsilon ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Evaluate ( _ 	lhs As Double, _ 	rhs As Double, _ 	epsilon As Double _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool Evaluate( 	double lhs,  	double rhs,  	double epsilon ) ``` |

#### Parameters

lhs
:   Type:  [System Double](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/643eft0t)    
     A value from an element in the document.

rhs
:   Type:  [System Double](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/643eft0t)    
     The user-supplied value against which values from the document are tested.

epsilon
:   Type:  [System Double](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/643eft0t)    
     Defines the tolerance within which two values may be considered equal.

#### Return Value

True if the given arguments satisfy the condition, otherwise false.

# Remarks

The arguments may be thought of as the left and right operands of a binary expression; for example, "a < b", "x >= 100", etc. The left operand comes from an element in the Revit document (e.g., the value of a parameter.) The right operand is supplied by the user when creating the filter that contains the rule that uses this evaluator.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The given value for lhs is not finite -or- The given value for lhs is not a number -or- The given value for rhs is not finite -or- The given value for rhs is not a number -or- The given value for epsilon is not finite -or- The given value for epsilon is not a number |
