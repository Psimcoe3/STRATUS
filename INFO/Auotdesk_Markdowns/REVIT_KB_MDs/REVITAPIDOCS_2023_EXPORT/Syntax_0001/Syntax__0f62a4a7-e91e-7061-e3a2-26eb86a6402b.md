#### Parameters

type
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FailureResolutionType](786e6422-f66d-5320-99f9-e530819e50a1.htm)    
     Type of the resolution to add. The type of resolution can be used only once for the FailureDefinition.

caption
:   Type:  System String    
     A simple description of the resolution.

classOfResolution
:   Type:  System Type    
     The runtime class of the resolution. Used to ensure that the actual FailureResoution object added to the instance of FailureMessage belongs to an applicable class.

#### Return Value

The FailureDefinition.

# Remarks

In order to inform Revit what failure resolutions can be possibly used with a given failure, a FailureDefinition must contain a full list of resolution types applicable to the failure, including user-visible caption and runtime class of the resolution. The number of resolutions is not limited. The first added resolution becomes the default resolution.
