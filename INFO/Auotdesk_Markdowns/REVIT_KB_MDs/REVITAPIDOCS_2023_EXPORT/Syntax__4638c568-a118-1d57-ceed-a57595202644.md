# Remarks

This class does not provide access to documents because it is provided to you through the ExternalApplication OnStartup()/OnShutdown() methods, and those methods are when it is not possible to work with Revit documents. You can work with documents by getting them from the UIApplication class; that class is obtained from events and ExternalCommand callbacks.
