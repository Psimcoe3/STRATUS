Implement this method to fill the provided buffer with points up to the number of maximum points for which the buffer was allocated.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds](5974062a-47d4-c7bb-16f2-d5dd193bd170.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2012

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` int ReadPoints( 	IntPtr buffer, 	int bufferSize ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Function ReadPoints ( _ 	buffer As IntPtr, _ 	bufferSize As Integer _ ) As Integer ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` int ReadPoints( 	IntPtr buffer,  	int bufferSize ) ``` |

#### Parameters

buffer
:   Type:  [System IntPtr](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5he14kz8)    
     Memory buffer into which the points should be written. The buffer was allocated by Revit and it is guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the call.

bufferSize
:   Type:  [System Int32](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/td2s409d)    
     The maximum number of CloudPoint objects that may be copied into the buffer.

#### Return Value

The actual number of CloudPoint objects placed in the buffer (can be less than the length of the buffer). If there are no more points available, return 0.
