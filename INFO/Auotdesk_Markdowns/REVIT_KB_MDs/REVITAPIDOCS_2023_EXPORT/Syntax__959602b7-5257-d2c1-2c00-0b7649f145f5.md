  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` RenderNodeAction OnViewBegin( 	ViewNode node ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Function OnViewBegin ( _ 	node As ViewNode _ ) As RenderNodeAction ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` RenderNodeAction OnViewBegin( 	ViewNode^ node ) ``` |

#### Parameters

node
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ViewNode](7cadfd9b-70df-5235-038f-a0535eee6f28.htm)    
     Geometry node associated with the view.

#### Return Value
