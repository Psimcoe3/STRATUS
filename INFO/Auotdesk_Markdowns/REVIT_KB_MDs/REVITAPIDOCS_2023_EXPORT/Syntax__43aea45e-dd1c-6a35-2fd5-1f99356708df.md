# Remarks

For view-based elements, the rotation angle is in the plane of the associated view. For model elements, the rotation angle is measured relative to the default coordinate system. This property is not supported for some elements supporting LocationPoints, such as AssemblyInstances, Groups, ModelText, Room, and SpotDimensions.
