Loads an entire family and all its types/symbols into the document and provides a reference to the loaded family.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 16.0.0.0 (16.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool LoadFamily( 	string filename, 	out Family family ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function LoadFamily ( _ 	filename As String, _ 	<OutAttribute> ByRef family As Family _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool LoadFamily( 	String^ filename,  	[OutAttribute] Family^% family ) ``` |

#### Parameters

filename
:   Type:  [System String](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1wwdcbf)    
     The fully qualified filename of the Family file, usually ending in .rfa.

family
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Family](f51d019d-6ff3-692b-d1d2-b497cab564de.htm)   %    
     A reference to the family that was loaded if successful, otherwise    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  .

#### Return Value

True if the entire family was loaded successfully into the project, otherwise False.

# Remarks

Loading an entire family may take a considerable amount of time and memory. It is recommended that you use one of the LoadFamilySymbol() methods and only load those symbols that you need.

```
// Get the Revit library path as defined via the Options dialog - File Locations tab - Places button
string libraryPath = "";

if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(libraryPath))
{
    libraryPath = "c:\\";   // If not have, use a default path.
}

// Allow the user to select a family file.
OpenFileDialog openFileDialog1 = new OpenFileDialog();
openFileDialog1.InitialDirectory = libraryPath;
openFileDialog1.Filter = "Family Files (*.rfa)|*.rfa";

// Load the family file using LoadFamily method and then give information.
if (DialogResult.OK == openFileDialog1.ShowDialog())
{
    Autodesk.Revit.DB.Family family = null;
    if (document.LoadFamily(openFileDialog1.FileName, out family))
    {
        String name = family.Name;
        TaskDialog.Show("Revit","Family file has been loaded. Its name is " + name);
