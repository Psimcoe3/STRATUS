Converts a group of SymbolicCurves to equivalent ModelCurves.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public ModelCurveArray ConvertSymbolicToModelCurves( 	View view, 	SymbolicCurveArray symbolicCurve ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function ConvertSymbolicToModelCurves ( _ 	view As View, _ 	symbolicCurve As SymbolicCurveArray _ ) As ModelCurveArray ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: ModelCurveArray^ ConvertSymbolicToModelCurves( 	View^ view,  	SymbolicCurveArray^ symbolicCurve ) ``` |

#### Parameters

view
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.htm)    
     The view where the new lines will be created. The lines are projected on the view workplane. The view workplane must be parallel to the view plane.

symbolicCurve
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB SymbolicCurveArray](a8ca9e0e-9838-96e4-5e6b-d5ffc11ea968.htm)    
     The symbolic curve array to be converted.

# Remarks

This operation will create new ModelCurves with the symbolicCurves' geometry curves and delete the SymbolicCurve in the array.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [System ArgumentNullException](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/27426hcy) | Thrown when the input argument is    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  . |
