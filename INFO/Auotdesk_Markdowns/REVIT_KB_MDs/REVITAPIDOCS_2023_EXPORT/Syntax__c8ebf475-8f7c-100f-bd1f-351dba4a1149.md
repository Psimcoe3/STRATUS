| [ViewShapeBuilder Class](f99edd24-4519-56d5-a5d6-aa1565a893af.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Validates curve to be added to the view-specific shape being constructed. Called by AddCurve() to validate input. Expects a valid view normal to be set prior to the call.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool ValidateCurve( 	Curve GCurve ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function ValidateCurve ( _ 	GCurve As Curve _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool ValidateCurve( 	Curve^ GCurve ) ``` |

#### Parameters

GCurve
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     Curve object to be validated.

#### Return Value

True is %GCurve% is acceptable as a part of view-specific shape representation being built.

# Remarks

This function may be used to pre-validate the geometry being added to avoid AddCurve() throwing an InvalidArgumentException Validation conditions depend on the type of view for which the shape representation is intended. For plan views, a curve is expected to be planar and non-degenerate (e.g., NOT a circle of zero radius).
