Defines a portion of an Analytical Model for an Element.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure](d586b341-f687-9d90-e96d-255806b7d4fc.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2011

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class AnalyticalModelSelector : IDisposable ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class AnalyticalModelSelector _ 	Implements IDisposable ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class AnalyticalModelSelector : IDisposable ``` |

# Remarks

This is used to identify the portion of an analytical model of interest to a client. To identify the portion of the analytical model, the client must identify the curve in question, by using one of the following:

* The specific curve within the analytical model.
* The index of the curve within the analytical model.

If a specific part of that curve is of interest, the client needs to identify that by specifying one of the following:

* The start of the curve.
* The end of the curve.
* The entire curve. This is the default behavior, so this does not need specifying.

      Reference endPointReference = analyticalModelFrame.GetReference(amSelector);
   }

   return true;
