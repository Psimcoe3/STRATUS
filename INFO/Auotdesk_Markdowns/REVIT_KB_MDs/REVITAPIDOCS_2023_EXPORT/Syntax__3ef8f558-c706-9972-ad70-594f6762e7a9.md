  **Since:**  2023

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static AnalyticalOpening Create( 	Document aDoc, 	CurveLoop curveLoop, 	ElementId panelId ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	aDoc As Document, _ 	curveLoop As CurveLoop, _ 	panelId As ElementId _ ) As AnalyticalOpening ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static AnalyticalOpening^ Create( 	Document^ aDoc,  	CurveLoop^ curveLoop,  	ElementId^ panelId ) ``` |

#### Parameters

aDoc
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     Revit document.

curveLoop
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)    
     CurveLoop for the Analytical Opening.

panelId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     ElementId of the AnalyticalPanel on which we create the Opening.

#### Return Value

The newly created AnalyticalOpening instance.

# Remarks

CurveLoop must be planar, not self-intersecting and in the same plane as the Analytical Panel. CurveLoop must intersect or to be inside the AnalyticalPanel contour. PanelId must be the ElementId of an AnalyticalPanel otherwise an exception is thrown.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | One of the following requirements is not satisfied : - curve loop curveLoop is not planar - curve loop curveLoop is self-intersecting - curve loop curveLoop contains zero length curves - curve loop curveLoop is not inside or does not intersect the AnalyticalPanel on which we want to create the Opening. - panelId is not the ElementId of an AnalyticalPanel - curve loop curveLoop is not in the same plane as the Analytical Panel |
