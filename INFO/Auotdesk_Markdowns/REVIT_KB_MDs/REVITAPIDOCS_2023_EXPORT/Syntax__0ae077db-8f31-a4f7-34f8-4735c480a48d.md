| [StairsLanding Class](cae109cd-bc50-6c36-300e-35d3457c0982.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Creates a customized landing between two runs by providing the closed boundary curves of the landing.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture](720f0c58-cb2b-4f13-374a-7348ed0a1cd3.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2013

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static StairsLanding CreateSketchedLanding( 	Document document, 	ElementId stairsId, 	CurveLoop curveLoop, 	double baseElevation ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateSketchedLanding ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	stairsId As ElementId, _ 	curveLoop As CurveLoop, _ 	baseElevation As Double _ ) As StairsLanding ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static StairsLanding^ CreateSketchedLanding( 	Document^ document,  	ElementId^ stairsId,  	CurveLoop^ curveLoop,  	double baseElevation ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document that owns the landing.

stairsId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The stairs that the new sketched landing belongs to.

curveLoop
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)    
     The closed boundary curves of the new landing.

baseElevation
:   Type:  System Double    
     Base elevation of the new stairs run. The elevation has following restriction:

    * The base elevation is relative to the base elevation of the stairs.
    * The base elevation will be rounded automatically to a multiple of the riser height.
    * The base elevation should be equal to or greater than half of the riser height.

#### Return Value

The new sketched landing.

# Remarks

The new stairs landing and the document will be regenerated. This should be run from within an open transaction.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The element stairsId does not exist in the document -or- The stairsId is not a valid stairs element. -or- The stairs stairsId has no valid landing type. -or- The curveLoop is not closed. -or- The input curveLoop contains at least one curve which is not a bound Line or bound Arc and is not supported for this operation. -or- Failed to create curve element by the curveLoop. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm) | The given value for baseElevation must be no more than 30000 feet in absolute value. -or- The baseElevation is less than half of the riser height of the stairs. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | The stairs element represented by stairsId is not in an active StairsEditScope. New components cannot be added to it. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.htm) | The document is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document is being loaded, or is in the midst of another sensitive process. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.htm) | The document has no open transaction. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions RegenerationFailedException](787bb389-74c2-5ce7-cdd6-32211209ded2.htm) | The curveLoop doesn't satisfy restrictions to generate sketched landing. |
