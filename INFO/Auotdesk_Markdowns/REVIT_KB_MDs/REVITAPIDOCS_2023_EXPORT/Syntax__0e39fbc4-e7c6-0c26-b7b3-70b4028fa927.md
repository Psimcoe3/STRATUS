# Remarks

A property that contains the latitude of the site location. The value of this property is in radians between +PI/2 and -PI/2.

When setting this property:

1. Revit will attempt to match the coordinates to a city it knows about, and if a match is found, will set the name accordingly.
2. Revit will attempt to automatically adjust the time zone value to match the new Latitude value set using  [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::SunAndShadowSettings::CalculateTimeZone]  . For some boundary cases, the time zone calculated may not be correct. You can set the  [TimeZone](6718329d-34ff-7d63-173a-c61905639807.htm)  property directly to the correct value if necessary.
3. Revit will attempt to automatically update the weather station associated with the location's coordinates.
