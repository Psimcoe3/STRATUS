| [NumberingSchema Class](8f2b22da-5963-301f-44d8-10c68828c436.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Shifts all numbers in the sequence so the starting number has the given value.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void ShiftNumbers( 	string partition, 	int firstNumber ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub ShiftNumbers ( _ 	partition As String, _ 	firstNumber As Integer _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void ShiftNumbers( 	String^ partition,  	int firstNumber ) ``` |

#### Parameters

partition
:   Type:  System String    
     Name of the partition that identifies the sequence. The sequence must exist.

firstNumber
:   Type:  System Int32    
     Value for the new first (lowest) number of the sequence.

# Remarks

A shift of all numbers in the sequence will be computed and applied so the first (lowest) number in the sequence would have the given value. All the other numbers will then be shifted relatively by the same amount.

Any existing gaps in the current numbering sequence will be preserved.

Shifts that would make the start number less than 1 or bigger than  [MaximumStartingNumber](f7a8b906-ee60-2a71-bc1a-30fa81b4f299.htm)  are considered invalid.
