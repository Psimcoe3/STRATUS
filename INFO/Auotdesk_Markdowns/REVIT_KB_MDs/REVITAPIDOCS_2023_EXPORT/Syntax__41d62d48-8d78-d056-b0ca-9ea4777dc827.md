# Syntax

#### Field Value

True if the parameter is reporting, False otherwise.

# Remarks

When a global parameter is declared as reporting, it takes its value from the one driving dimension it is set to label. To be declared as reporting, a parameter must be labeling no more than one single-segment dimension. If a global parameter is not labeling any dimensions at the time it is declared as reporting, its value stays unchanged until a driving dimension is labeled with it.

Reporting parameters can be (currently) only of type  **Length**  or  **Angle**  , but programmers can always call the  [HasValidTypeForReporting](8ec3a25e-018b-8903-01d1-6201531c50a0.htm)  first when in doubt about whether a global parameter has a data type eligible for reporting.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | When setting this property: This is a formula-driven parameter. As such it does not allow the current operation. -or- When setting this property: This non-reporting global parameter has already labeled other dimensions (more then 1). It cannot, therefore, be made reporting and dimension-driven before un-labeling all the dependent dimensions first. -or- When setting this property: The global parameter is not of a type that may be used with reporting. Generally, a reporting parameter must be either of type Length or Angle. -or- When setting this property: Currently reporting parameters may not be changed if they are driven by a dimension that cannot have its value set by a global parameter, such as an arc-length, locked, or multi-segment dimension. |
