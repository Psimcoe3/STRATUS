| --- |
| ``` public: PipingSystem^ NewPipingSystem( 	Connector^ baseEquipmentConnector,  	ConnectorSet^ connectors,  	PipeSystemType pipingSystemType ) ``` |

#### Parameters

baseEquipmentConnector
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.htm)    
     One connector within base equipment which is used to connect with the system. The base equipment is optional for the system, so this argument may be    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  . The baseEquipmentConnector should not be included in the connectors.

pipingSystemType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Plumbing PipeSystemType](24165d09-9267-54b7-3e32-6405d1343c2e.htm)    
     The System type.
