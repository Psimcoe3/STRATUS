# Members

| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Simplified | Rough and semi-rough materials are approximated. Consequently, materials may look more shinier than expected. Lighting is approximated so shadows will lack in details. |
| Advanced | Soft shadows and soft reflections from semi-rough materials will be rendered with a high quality level. This is the standard setting that you typically want to rely on for final high quality renderings. |
