| [Wire Class](c2acf13b-0d8b-8415-9682-ae64eb5e5895.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Sets the position of a given vertex. If the vertex is start or end point, and the wire connects to electrical device, the wire end offset will be set according to the given vertex. If the vertex is start or end point, and the wire connects to other wire, user can't set the vertex and exception will be thrown. If the vertex is start or end point, and the wire connects to nothing, the vertex will be set as the given vertex.

#### Parameters

index
:   Type:  System Int32

vertexPoint
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The new position for the vertex.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The index should be between 0 and the number of vertices of the wire. -or- The vertex point cannot be added to the wire because there is already a vertex at this position on the view plane (within tolerance). |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions DisabledDisciplineException](3693dcdf-67fb-0128-3be8-cad150e9498e.htm) | None of the following disciplines is enabled: Mechanical Electrical Piping. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | Can't set the vertex when the vertex is start or end point and the wire connects to other wire. |
