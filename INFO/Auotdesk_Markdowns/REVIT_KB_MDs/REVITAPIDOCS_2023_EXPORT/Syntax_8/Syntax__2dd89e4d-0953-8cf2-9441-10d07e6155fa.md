| [RebarShape Class](0a370e32-eaba-785e-7e1f-9330929525fc.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Create a new instance of a Rebar Shape, which defines the shape of a rebar.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure](d586b341-f687-9d90-e96d-255806b7d4fc.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2012

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static RebarShape Create( 	Document doc, 	RebarShapeDefinition definition, 	RebarShapeMultiplanarDefinition multiplanarDefinition, 	RebarStyle style, 	StirrupTieAttachmentType attachmentType, 	int startHookAngle, 	RebarHookOrientation startHookOrientation, 	int endHookAngle, 	RebarHookOrientation endHookOrientation, 	int higherEnd ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |

| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	doc As Document, _ 	definition As RebarShapeDefinition, _ 	multiplanarDefinition As RebarShapeMultiplanarDefinition, _ 	style As RebarStyle, _ 	attachmentType As StirrupTieAttachmentType, _ 	startHookAngle As Integer, _ 	startHookOrientation As RebarHookOrientation, _ 	endHookAngle As Integer, _ 	endHookOrientation As RebarHookOrientation, _ 	higherEnd As Integer _ ) As RebarShape ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public: static RebarShape^ Create( 	Document^ doc,  	RebarShapeDefinition^ definition,  	RebarShapeMultiplanarDefinition^ multiplanarDefinition,  	RebarStyle style,  	StirrupTieAttachmentType attachmentType,  	int startHookAngle,  	RebarHookOrientation startHookOrientation,  	int endHookAngle,  	RebarHookOrientation endHookOrientation,  	int higherEnd ) ``` |

#### Parameters

doc
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     A document to contain the RebarShape.

definition
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarShapeDefinition](bb1f59be-c95e-a45b-8d2b-8121df179676.htm)    
     The definition of the rebar shape, as a set of curves in a plane driven by parameters.

multiplanarDefinition
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarShapeMultiplanarDefinition](47a3135c-ce53-c041-f551-0795767eaa41.htm)    
     If not null, the created RebarShape will be a 3D shape. The shape is built out of the planar RebarShapeDefinition, with additional out-of-plane segments defined by the RebarShapeMultiplanarDefinition object. Not supported in conjunction with RebarShapeDefinitionByArc of type Spiral or LappedCircle.

style
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarStyle](a9ac65a6-29e6-25e5-caca-502e21385f47.htm)    
     Whether the shape is to be used as a standard bar or a stirrup/tie.

attachmentType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure StirrupTieAttachmentType](01887c64-36b1-1f7f-5ff9-1fb3ba4f3023.htm)    
     When the style is stirrup/tie, specify whether it will attach to the interior of cover (cover is measured to the stirrups), or to the exterior of cover (cover is measured to the standard bars). Ignored when the style is Standard.

startHookAngle
:   Type:  System Int32    
     The start hook angle, expressed as an integral number of degrees. If 0, the shape will have no start hook. Common values are 0, 90, 135, and 180.

startHookOrientation
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.htm)    
     The orientation of the start hook. Ignored when startHookAngle is 0.

endHookAngle
:   Type:  System Int32    
     The end hook angle, expressed as an integral number of degrees. If 0, the shape will have no end hook. Common values are 0, 90, 135, and 180.

endHookOrientation
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.htm)    
     The orientation of the end hook. Ignored when endHookAngle is 0.

higherEnd
:   Type:  System Int32    
     When the rebar crosses itself, one end will be "lifted" to avoid self-intersection. Specify which end should be lifted: 0 for start, 1 for end.

#### Return Value

A new RebarShape instance.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | definition is linked to a Document other than doc. -or- A multiplanar definition is specified when the given RebarShapeDefinition does not support it. The following RebarShapeDefinitions do not support multiplanar: a simple line; spiral; lapped circle. -or- The DepthParamId property of multiplanarDefinition is invalid or has not been added to definition. |
