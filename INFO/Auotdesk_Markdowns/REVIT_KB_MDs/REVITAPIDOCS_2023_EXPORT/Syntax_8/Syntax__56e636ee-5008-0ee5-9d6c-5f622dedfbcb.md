Gets the document of a loaded family to edit.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public Document EditFamily( 	Family loadedFamily ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function EditFamily ( _ 	loadedFamily As Family _ ) As Document ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: Document^ EditFamily( 	Family^ loadedFamily ) ``` |

#### Parameters

loadedFamily
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Family](f51d019d-6ff3-692b-d1d2-b497cab564de.htm)    
     The loaded family in current document.

#### Return Value

Reference of the document of the family.

# Remarks

This creates an independent copy of the family for editing. To apply the changes back to the family stored in the document, use the LoadFamily overload accepting  [IFamilyLoadOptions](d447ed92-74e1-2125-dd0a-38a5ae85ce53.htm)  .

This method may not be called if the document is currently modifiable (has an open transaction) or is in a read-only state. The method may not be called during dynamic updates. To test the document's current status, check the values of IsModifiable and IsReadOnly properties.
