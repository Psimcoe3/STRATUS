# Remarks

Simple 3D rebar shapes are supported by adding segments to a regular 2D shape definition. The added segments consist of three optional parts: a "duplicate shape" and two connectors. A "duplicate shape" is a second copy of the 2D shape, offset in a perpendicular direction, and connected at either the start or the end by a perpendicular connector segment. Also supported is adding one or both connector segments, without the duplicate shape. Fillets are applied to the connector segments with a diameter that is given by the OutOfPlaneBendDiameter property. The length of the connectors is given by the Rebar instance parameter "multiplanar depth." The MultiplanarDepth property of this class is the default value of the parameter.
