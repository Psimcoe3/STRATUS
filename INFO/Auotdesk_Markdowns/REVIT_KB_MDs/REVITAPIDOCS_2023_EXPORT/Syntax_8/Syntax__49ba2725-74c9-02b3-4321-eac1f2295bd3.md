The range of valid result values depends on the type of dialog as follows:

1. DialogBox: Any non-zero value will cause a dialog to be dismissed.
2. MessageBox: Standard Message Box IDs, such as IDOK and IDCANCEL, are accepted. For all possible IDs, refer to the Windows API documentation. The ID used must be relevant to the buttons in a message box.
3. TaskDialog: Standard Message Box IDs and Revit Custom IDs are accepted, depending on the buttons used in a dialog. Standard buttons, such as OK and Cancel, have standard IDs described in Windows API documentation. Buttons with custom text have custom IDs with incremental values starting at 1001 for the left-most or top-most button in a task dialog.
