#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)

# Remarks

After unsetting the active server, the document will be using the application-wide active server, if one was already set.

Note it is not possible to unset a server that acts as an application-wide active server for a service. On the other hand, there should be no reason to ever do so, for each and every registered service should have (ideally) an active server set applicatiton-wide.
