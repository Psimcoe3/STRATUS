Gets the static pressure of this mechanical system.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical](0eafd899-5912-56fd-94b1-d286156e26fc.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 17.0.0.0 (17.0.1090.0)   
  **Since:**  2017

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double GetStaticPressure() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetStaticPressure As Double ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: double GetStaticPressure() ``` |

# Remarks

The system static pressure is calculated in the non-blocking evaluation framework. The caller may set up callbacks that react to the asynchronous calculation results. If no callback is set up (e.g, called from third-party applications), the calculation is automatically switched to synchronous calculation so the caller can access the up-to-date result. Similarly, the public method get\_ParameterValue(BuiltInParameter.RBS\_DUCT\_STATIC\_PRESSURE) has the same behavior. Due to this change, the parameter RBS\_DUCT\_STATIC\_PRESSURE no longer supports dynamic model update.
