| [StairsRun Class](ea0e49a0-a007-79d0-c902-a24b1359ae28.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Creates a spiral run in the project document by providing the center, start angle and included angle.

  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2013

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static StairsRun CreateSpiralRun( 	Document document, 	ElementId stairsId, 	XYZ center, 	double radius, 	double startAngle, 	double includedAngle, 	bool clockwise, 	StairsRunJustification justification ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateSpiralRun ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	stairsId As ElementId, _ 	center As XYZ, _ 	radius As Double, _ 	startAngle As Double, _ 	includedAngle As Double, _ 	clockwise As Boolean, _ 	justification As StairsRunJustification _ ) As StairsRun ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public: static StairsRun^ CreateSpiralRun( 	Document^ document,  	ElementId^ stairsId,  	XYZ^ center,  	double radius,  	double startAngle,  	double includedAngle,  	bool clockwise,  	StairsRunJustification justification ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document.

stairsId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The stairs that the new stairs run will belong to.

center
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The center of the location arc of the spiral run. The Z coordinate of the center is the base elevation for the new run (in model coordinates). It must be greater than or equal to the stairs base elevation.

radius
:   Type:  System Double    
     The radius of the location arc of the spiral run.

startAngle
:   Type:  System Double    
     The start angle of the location arc of the spiral run. The angle's coordinate system is world coordinate system which always is XYZ.BasisX and XYZ.BasisY.

includedAngle
:   Type:  System Double    
     The total angle covered by the spiral run. Must be a positive value (direction is determined by the clockwise flag).

clockwise
:   Type:  System Boolean    
     True if the spiral run will be created along clockwise direction, False otherwise.

justification
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture StairsRunJustification](4d75bda7-267b-dc0e-286a-b5efb839655f.htm)    
     The location path justification of the new stairs run.

#### Return Value

The new stairs run.

# Remarks

The new stairs run and the document will be regenerated. This should be run from within an open transaction.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The stairsId is not a valid stairs element. -or- The given value for startAngle is not finite -or- The input center is not a valid center for spiral run (probably the Z coordinate doesn't meet the restrictions) -or- The includedAngle doesn't satisfy riser restriction to generate spiral run (probably it's too small). |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm) | The given value for radius must be greater than 0 and no more than 30000 feet. -or- The given value for includedAngle must be positive. -or- A value passed for an enumeration argument is not a member of that enumeration |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentsInconsistentException](05972c68-fa6d-3a83-d720-ad84fbc4780f.htm) | The radius is too small to generate a spiral run at the given justification. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | The stairs element represented by stairsId is not in an active StairsEditScope. New components cannot be added to it. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.htm) | The document is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document is being loaded, or is in the midst of another sensitive process. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.htm) | The document has no open transaction. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions RegenerationFailedException](787bb389-74c2-5ce7-cdd6-32211209ded2.htm) | The center, radius, startAngle, includedAngle don't satisfy restrictions to generate spiral run. |
