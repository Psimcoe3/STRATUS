# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double NormalTolerance { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |

# Remarks

This property can be set by using export resolution type (by creation of STLExportOptions or using  [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::STLExportOptions::setTessellationSettings(ExportResolution::Enum)]  method). In the case of Fine (10.0 degrees), Medium (15.0 degrees) and Coarse (30.0 degrees) resolutions, this property is considered as explicitly set by the user. In the case of Custom resolution type, this property is only allowed to be obtained if it has been explicitly set.
