#### Return Value

If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Committed

# Remarks

The changes are not permanently committed to the document yet. They will be committed only when the active transaction is committed. If the transaction is rolled back instead, the changes committed during this sub-transaction will be discarded.

Commit can be called only when all inner sub-transactions, if any, are already finished, i.e. they were either committed or rolled back. If there is still a sub-transaction open, an attempt to commit this outer sub-transaction will cause an exception.
