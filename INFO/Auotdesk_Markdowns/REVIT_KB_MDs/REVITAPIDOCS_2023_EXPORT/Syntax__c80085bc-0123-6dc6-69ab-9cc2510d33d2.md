#### Return Value

A collection of link ExternalResourceReferences which failed to load.

# Remarks

In cases, where a nested structure of several links were loaded, this method is intended to be a convenient way for IExternalResourceUIServers to determine whether a top-level link, or any sub-link, which failed to load properly was provided by their IExternalResourceServer or another server.

If this link and all nested links loaded successfully, then an empty list is returned.
