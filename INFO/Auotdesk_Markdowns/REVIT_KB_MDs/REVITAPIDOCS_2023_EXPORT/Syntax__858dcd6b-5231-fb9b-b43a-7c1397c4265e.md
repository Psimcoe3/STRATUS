The Resolution of the image is expressed in dots-per-inch and hence determines the size of a pixel in the image.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 21.0.0.0 (21.1.1.109)   
  **Since:**  2020

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double Resolution { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property Resolution As Double 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property double Resolution { 	double get (); 	void set (double value); } ``` |

# Remarks

For raster based image formats (\*.bmp, \*.jpg, \*.jpeg, \*.png, \*.tif) the Resolution is used to calculate the size of the image from the number of pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions.

For PDF files, which have a known paper size, the Resolution is used to control the amount of detail to capture in the image. Increasing the Resolution of PDF based images will add more detail to the image, but will also increase the amount of data stored in the project file.

The default value of this property is 72 dpi.
