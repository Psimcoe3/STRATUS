**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.DirectContext3D](f4ba10f0-55ea-5344-173b-688405391794.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 18.0.0.0 (18.2.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2017

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool IsValid() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function IsValid As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool IsValid() ``` |

#### Return Value

True if the vertex format specification is valid for rendering, false otherwise.

# Remarks

The vertex format specifications are internally associated with low-level graphics state and may become invalidated when the state changes. Therefore, an application should test each vertex format object for validity before using it when submitting geometry. If the vertex format object becomes invalid, the application should re-create it.
