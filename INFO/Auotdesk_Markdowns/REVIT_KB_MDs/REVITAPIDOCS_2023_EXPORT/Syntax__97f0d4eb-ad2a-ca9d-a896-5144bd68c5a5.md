| [WorksharingUtils Class](ae7857a0-4e9b-f9c1-84c7-8b250af68068.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Obtains ownership for the current user of as many specified worksets as possible.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static ICollection<WorksetId> CheckoutWorksets( 	Document document, 	ICollection<WorksetId> worksetsToCheckout ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CheckoutWorksets ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	worksetsToCheckout As ICollection(Of WorksetId) _ ) As ICollection(Of WorksetId) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static ICollection<WorksetId^>^ CheckoutWorksets( 	Document^ document,  	ICollection<WorksetId^>^ worksetsToCheckout ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document containing the worksets.

worksetsToCheckout
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic ICollection   [WorksetId](8bece327-c269-8101-b4c2-38632f593fe6.htm)    
     The ids of the worksets to attempt to check out.

#### Return Value

The ids of all specified worksets that are now owned, including all that were owned prior to the function call.

# Remarks

For best performance, check out all worksets in one big call, rather than many small calls.

When there comes a contention error when locking the central model, this API would wait and retry endlessly until getting the lock of the central model.

void CheckoutAllViewWorksets(Document doc)
{
    FilteredWorksetCollector collector = new FilteredWorksetCollector(doc);

    // find all view worksets
    collector.OfKind(WorksetKind.ViewWorkset);
    ICollection<WorksetId> viewworksets = collector.ToWorksetIds();
    ICollection<WorksetId> checkoutworksets = WorksharingUtils.CheckoutWorksets(doc, viewworksets);
    TaskDialog.Show("Checked out worksets", "Number of worksets checked out: " + checkoutworksets.Count);
}
```
