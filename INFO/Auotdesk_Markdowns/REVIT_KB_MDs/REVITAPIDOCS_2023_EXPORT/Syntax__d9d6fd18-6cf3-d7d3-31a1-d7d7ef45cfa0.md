Creates a new MEP mechanical system element.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.Creation](ded320da-058a-4edd-0418-0582389559a7.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public MechanicalSystem NewMechanicalSystem( 	Connector baseEquipmentConnector, 	ConnectorSet connectors, 	DuctSystemType ductSystemType ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function NewMechanicalSystem ( _ 	baseEquipmentConnector As Connector, _ 	connectors As ConnectorSet, _ 	ductSystemType As DuctSystemType _ ) As MechanicalSystem ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: MechanicalSystem^ NewMechanicalSystem( 	Connector^ baseEquipmentConnector,  	ConnectorSet^ connectors,  	DuctSystemType ductSystemType ) ``` |

#### Parameters

baseEquipmentConnector
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.htm)    
     One connector within base equipment which is used to connect with the system. The base equipment is optional for the system, so this argument may be    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  . The baseEquipmentConnector should not be included in the connectors.

connectors
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ConnectorSet](a9821fc1-54cf-5f69-13a9-25d506ecb048.htm)    
     Connectors that will connect to the system. The owner elements of these connectors will be added into system as its elements.

ductSystemType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical DuctSystemType](108631a7-6d3a-a5f6-cc0c-0579ca8cf999.htm)    
     The system type.

#### Return Value

If creation was successful then an instance of mechanical system is returned, otherwise an exception with information will be thrown.

# Remarks

This method will regenerate the document even in manual regeneration mode.
