# Remarks

A link cycle occurs when, for example, model A links model B as an attachment, which links model C as an attachment, which links model A as an attachment. Revit will only load one copy of model A; it will ignore the instance of A linked under C. Circular links do not abort the load process, so they do not appear as a result type in LinkLoadResultType.Enum. This property is only relevant for LinkLoadResult object for RvtLinkSymbol. ie. when getIsRvtLink() is true.
