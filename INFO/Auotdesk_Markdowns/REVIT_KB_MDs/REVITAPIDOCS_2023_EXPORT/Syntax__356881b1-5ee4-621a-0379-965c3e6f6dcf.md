A filter used to match rooms.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture](720f0c58-cb2b-4f13-374a-7348ed0a1cd3.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class RoomFilter : ElementSlowFilter ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class RoomFilter _ 	Inherits ElementSlowFilter ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class RoomFilter : public ElementSlowFilter ``` |

# Remarks

This filter is a slow filter, but it uses a quick filter to eliminate non-candidate elements before the elements are obtained and expanded. Therefore this filter does not have to be paired with another quick filter to minimize the number of Elements that are expanded.

# Examples

```
// Use a RoomFilter to find all room elements in the document. It is necessary to use the RoomFilter, 
// and not an ElementClassFilter or the shortcut method OfClass() because the Room class is not 
// supported by those methods.
RoomFilter filter = new RoomFilter();

// Apply the filter to the elements in the active document
FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
IList<Element> rooms = collector.WherePasses(filter).ToElements();
```
