#### Return Value

If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.RolledBack.

# Remarks

The parent transaction (or a parent sub-transaction, if any) can still be committed, but the changes rolled back by this method will not be part of the committed transaction.

RollBack can be called only when all inner sub-transaction, if any, are finished, i.e. they were either committed or rolled back. If there is still a sub-transaction open, an attempt to roll this outer sub-transaction back will cause an exception.
