| [NurbsSurfaceData Class](7d65dbde-8aac-7d7d-e811-a6c91a541de4.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Construct NurbsSurfaceData based on NURBS surface data, where the weights are supplied. The NURBS surface will be (piecewise) polynomial if all the weights are equal, rational if not. Note: A rational polynomial is a quotient of two polynomials; this includes a polynomial, which can be thought of as a quotient with denominator equal to 1.

| ``` public: static NurbsSurfaceData^ Create( 	int degreeU,  	int degreeV,  	IList<double>^ knotsU,  	IList<double>^ knotsV,  	IList<XYZ^>^ controlPoints,  	IList<double>^ weights,  	bool bReverseOrientation ) ``` |

#### Parameters

degreeU
:   Type:  System Int32    
     The degree of the spline in the u-direction; must be positive.

degreeV
:   Type:  System Int32    
     The degree of the spline in the v-direction; must be positive.

knotsU
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   Double    
     Knot values in the u-direction. The number of knots in the u-direction must be at least 2 \* (degreeU + 1).

knotsV
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   Double    
     Knot values in the v-direction. The number of knots in the v-direction must be at least 2 \* (degreeV + 1).

controlPoints
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     One dimensional array of points representing the two dimensional net of control points of the NURBS surface in u and v directions.

    The total number of control points must equal numControlPtsU times numControlPtsV, where numControlPtsU and numControlPtsV are the numbers of control points in u and v directions, and they must satisfy the following conditions:

    * numControlPtsU = number of knots in u - degreeU - 1.
    * numControlPtsV = number of knots in v - degreeV - 1.

    The convention for 2d (idxU, idxV) to 1d (idx) conversion of array indexes: idxV first. That is, idxU is outer loop and idxV is inner loop. In other words, idx = idxU \* numControlPtsV + idxV.

weights
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   Double    
     Array of weights assigned to the control points. The number of weights must equal the number of control points. All weights should be greater than zero.

bReverseOrientation
:   Type:  System Boolean    
     If true, the surface's orientation is opposite to the canonical parametric orientation, otherwise it is the same. The canonical parametric orientation is a counter-clockwise sense of rotation in the uv-parameter plane. Extrinsically, the oriented normal vector for the canonical parametric orientation points in the direction of the cross product dS/du x dS/dv, which S(u, v) is the parameterized surface.
