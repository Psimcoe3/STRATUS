# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public XYZ Elbow { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property XYZ^ Elbow { 	XYZ^ get (); 	void set (XYZ^ value); } ``` |

# Remarks

This is the mid-point of the leader and its purpose depends on the shape of the leader. For arc-shaped leaders it defines the radius of the arc. For a kinked leader it divides the leader line and shoulder line.

Note that straight-line leaders do not have an actual elbow; however, the value can still be obtained, although it will always equal the current anchor point. Consequently, an elbow point can be set even on a straight-line leader, but doing so will automatically change the leader's shape property.

It is allowed to set the Elbow point of a kinked leader to equal either the end point or anchor point of the leader. Doing so will effectively change the leader's shape to a straight line. However, the elbow of an arc leader is never allowed to be placed on either the end or anchor point.
