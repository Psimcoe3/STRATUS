A ruled surface is created by sweeping a line between two profile curves or between a curve and a point (a point and a curve). Input curve(s) must be bounded or have natural bounds.

  **Since:**  2017

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class RuledSurface : Surface ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class RuledSurface _ 	Inherits Surface ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class RuledSurface : public Surface ``` |

# Remarks

Both curves are evaluated in normalized parameters [0, 1] The parametric equations of a ruled surface are: C1 != 0 and C2 != 0 : S(u, v) = C1(u) + v \* (C2(u) - C1(u)); C2 == 0 and C1 != 0 : S(u, v) = P1 + v \* (C2(u) - P1); C1 == 0 and C2 != 0 : S(u, v) = C1(u) + v \* (P2 - C1(u)); C1 == 0 and C2 == 0 - is not allowed as that would define a degenerate ruled surface.
