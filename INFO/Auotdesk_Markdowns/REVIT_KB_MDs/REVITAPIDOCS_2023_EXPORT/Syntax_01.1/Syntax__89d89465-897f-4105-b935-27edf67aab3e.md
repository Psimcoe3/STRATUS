# Remarks

The Units class represents a document's default settings for formatting numbers with units as strings. It contains a  [FormatOptions](70f78207-1109-3906-8e67-cd27df1f0ae8.htm)  object for each unit type as well as settings related to decimal symbol and digit grouping.

The Units class stores a FormatOptions object for every valid unit type, but not all of them can be directly modified. Some, like UT\_Number and UT\_SiteAngle, have fixed definitions. Others have definitions which are automatically derived from other unit types. For example, UT\_SheetLength is derived from UT\_Length and UT\_ForceScale is derived from UT\_Force. See  [IsModifiableUnitType()](8c60b3e9-d996-435d-33fb-e475ee78a41e.htm)  and  [GetModifiableUnitTypes()](480ae2b2-e543-5156-ac1e-650756d6669d.htm)  .
