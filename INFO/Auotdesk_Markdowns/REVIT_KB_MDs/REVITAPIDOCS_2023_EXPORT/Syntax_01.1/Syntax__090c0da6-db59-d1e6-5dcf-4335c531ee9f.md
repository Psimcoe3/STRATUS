#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document in which the RevisionCloud should be created.

view
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.htm)    
     The View in which the RevisionCloud should appear.

revisionId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The Revision to associate with the new RevisionCloud.

curves
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The curves that will form the RevisionCloud's sketch.

#### Return Value

The newly created RevisionCloud.

# Remarks

Creates a new RevisionCloud in the specified View. The new RevisionCloud will be associated with the specified Revision. RevisionClouds can only be created if the Revision has not yet been issued.

RevisionClouds can be created in most graphical Views, excepting 3D views and graphical column schedules. Unlike most other Elements, RevisionClouds can be created directly on a ViewSheet.

RevisionClouds are created based on a series of sketched curves. There is no requirement that the curves form closed loops and self-intersections are also permitted. The curves will be automatically projected onto the appropriate plane for the View. The list of curves cannot be empty and any lines cannot be perpendicular to the View's plane. If the View is a model View, the coordinates specified for the curves will be interpreted in model space. If the View is a non-model View (such as a ViewSheet) then the coordinates will be interpreted in the View's space.

The cloud graphics will be attached to the curves under the assumption that each curve is oriented in a clockwise direction. For lines, this means that the outside of the cloud is in the direction of the line's normal vector within the View's plane. Any closed loops should therefore be oriented clockwise to create the typical cloud shape.
