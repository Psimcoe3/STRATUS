| --- |
| [Face Class](e32b3b1f-66fc-57cb-6e1c-aa81d1bf3e63.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Calculates the intersection of the specified curve with this face and returns the intersection results.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public SetComparisonResult Intersect( 	Curve curve, 	out IntersectionResultArray results ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Intersect ( _ 	curve As Curve, _ 	<OutAttribute> ByRef results As IntersectionResultArray _ ) As SetComparisonResult ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: SetComparisonResult Intersect( 	Curve^ curve,  	[OutAttribute] IntersectionResultArray^% results ) ``` |

#### Parameters

curve
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The specified curve to intersect with this face.

results
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB IntersectionResultArray](4742c1e8-0566-73c6-de42-04d98a503dfc.htm)   %    
     Provides more information about the intersection.

#### Return Value

* SetComparisonResult.Overlap - One or more intersections were encountered. The output argument has the results.
* SetComparisonResult.Subset - The curve is coincident with the surface.
* SetComparisonResult.Disjoint - There is no intersection found.

# Remarks

The array of the intersection results contains one entry for each point where this face and the curve intersect. The following is the meaning of IntersectionResult's members:

* XYZPoint is the evaluated intersection point.
* UVPoint is the intersection parameters on the face.
* Parameter is the raw intersection parameter on the curve.
* EdgeObject is the edge if the intersection happens to be near an edge of the face.
* EdgeParameter is the parameter of the nearest point on the edge.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | The curve is    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  . |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | The intersection calculation fails. |
