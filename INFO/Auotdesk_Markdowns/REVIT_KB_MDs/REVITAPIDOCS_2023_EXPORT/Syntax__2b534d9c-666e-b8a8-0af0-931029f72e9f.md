| [FilledRegion Class](3685651c-a789-3550-f6bb-7c1decc29079.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Creates a filled region on a sketch plane in a 3d model family.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2023

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static FilledRegion Create( 	Document document, 	ElementId typeId, 	SketchPlane sketchPlane, 	IList<CurveLoop> boundaries ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	typeId As ElementId, _ 	sketchPlane As SketchPlane, _ 	boundaries As IList(Of CurveLoop) _ ) As FilledRegion ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static FilledRegion^ Create( 	Document^ document,  	ElementId^ typeId,  	SketchPlane^ sketchPlane,  	IList<CurveLoop^>^ boundaries ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The family document in which to create the filled region.

typeId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The filled region type Id.

sketchPlane
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB SketchPlane](ba104029-d175-7e75-caef-667a4281f4af.htm)    
     The sketch plane for use with the filled region.

boundaries
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)    
     The filled region boundaries, which will be projected onto the sketch plane.

#### Return Value

The new filled region.

# Remarks

If the sketch plane is currently in use, then a copy of the sketch plane will be created and used. The sketch plane normal must be parallel to the model's X, Y or Z axis. The sketch plane can be a planar face reference to model geometry. The line style of the boundaries will be set to thin lines by default.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The document is not a 3d model family. -or- The Id typeId is invalid. -or- Filled regions can't be created in this document or view. -or- The sketch plane is not suitable for model elements. -or- The sketch plane normal is not parallel to the model's X, Y or Z axis. -or- The input curve loops cannot compose a valid boundary, that means: the "curveLoops" collection is empty; or some curve loops intersect with each other; or each curve loop is not closed individually; or each curve loop is not planar; or each curve loop is not in a plane parallel to the sketch plane; or input curves contain at least one helical curve. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
