Returns a new perspective View3D.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2013

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static View3D CreatePerspective( 	Document document, 	ElementId viewFamilyTypeId ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreatePerspective ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	viewFamilyTypeId As ElementId _ ) As View3D ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static View3D^ CreatePerspective( 	Document^ document,  	ElementId^ viewFamilyTypeId ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document to which the new View3D will be added.

viewFamilyTypeId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The id of the ViewFamilyType which will be used by the new View3D. The type needs to be a ThreeDimensional ViewType.

#### Return Value

The new perspective View3D.

# Remarks

The new View3D will receive a unique view name. The view will be oriented in the same position as the default 3D view.

```
' Find a 3D view type
Dim collector1 As New FilteredElementCollector(document)

                  Let vftype = TryCast(elem, ViewFamilyType) _
                  Where vftype.ViewFamily = ViewFamily.ThreeDimensional _
                  Select vftype
' Create a new Perspective View3D
Dim view3D__1 As View3D = View3D.CreatePerspective(document, viewFamilyTypes.First().Id)
If view3D__1 IsNot Nothing Then
    ' By default, the 3D view uses a default orientation.
    ' Change the orientation by creating and setting a ViewOrientation3D 
    Dim eye As New XYZ(0, -100, 10)
    Dim up As New XYZ(0, 0, 1)
    Dim forward As New XYZ(0, 1, 0)
    view3D__1.SetOrientation(New ViewOrientation3D(eye, up, forward))

    ' turn off the far clip plane with standard parameter API
    Dim farClip As Parameter = view3D__1.LookupParameter("Far Clip Active")
    farClip.[Set](0)
End If
