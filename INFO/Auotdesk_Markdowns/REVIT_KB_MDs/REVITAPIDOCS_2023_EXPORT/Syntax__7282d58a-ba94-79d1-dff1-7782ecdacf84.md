# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static bool IsAvailable() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |

#### Return Value

True if the DrawContext is available for rendering, false otherwise.

# Remarks

This class can perform drawing operations and access the state of parameters related to drawing only in lock-step with rendering inside of Revit. As a consequence, the facilities of this class are not available for use outside of the scope determined by the callback  [RenderScene(View, DisplayStyle)](d8e515cc-5b81-e835-5d60-5b409e0706d8.htm)  . Certain methods of other DirectContext3D objects, e.g., VertexBuffer::Map() are similarly restricted by the same scope.
