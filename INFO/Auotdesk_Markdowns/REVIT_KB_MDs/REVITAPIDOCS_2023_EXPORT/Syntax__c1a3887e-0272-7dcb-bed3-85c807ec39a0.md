# Remarks

The RepeatingReferenceSource class is the building block for setting up component repeaters. Repeating references are arranged in zero, one or two dimensional arrays. The RepeatingReferenceSource class represents this array of references and provides access to individual repeating references.

Note that there may be gaps in the array (for example a repeating reference source formed by a divided surface with holes, or is non-rectangular surface.)

Repeating reference sources are a property of an element. Only point elements, divided paths and divided surface elements support repeating reference sources. These element respectively have 0, 1 and 2 dimensional repeating references. Use the HasRepeatingReferenceSource() method to query whether an element supports repeating reference sources and the GetDefaultRepeatingReferenceSource() method to obtain a repeating reference source from a given element.
