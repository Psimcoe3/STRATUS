Creates a 2D BeamSystem with specified profile curves.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static BeamSystem Create( 	Document document, 	IList<Curve> profile, 	SketchPlane sketchPlane, 	int curveIndexForDirection ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	profile As IList(Of Curve), _ 	sketchPlane As SketchPlane, _ 	curveIndexForDirection As Integer _ ) As BeamSystem ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static BeamSystem^ Create( 	Document^ document,  	IList<Curve^>^ profile,  	SketchPlane^ sketchPlane,  	int curveIndexForDirection ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document in which the new BeamSystem is created.

profile
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The profile of the BeamSystem.

sketchPlane
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB SketchPlane](ba104029-d175-7e75-caef-667a4281f4af.htm)    
     The work-plane for the BeamSystem.

curveIndexForDirection
:   Type:  System Int32    
     Index of the curve in the profile to be used as direction. '0' means the default direction-to use the first curve in profile. The curve from the profile to be used as direction must be a Line.

#### Return Value

If successful, a new BeamSystem object will be returned.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | SketchPlane is not valid for BeamSystem creation. -or- The input profile contains at least one helical curve and is not supported for this operation. -or- The profile curves must be in the sketch plane. -or- The curve index must be valid and the curve to be used as direction must be a Line. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationForbiddenException](53205486-5917-7c33-8e67-e362106ddc97.htm) | The document is in failure mode: an operation has failed, and Revit requires the user to either cancel the operation or fix the problem (usually by deleting certain elements). -or- The document is being loaded, or is in the midst of another sensitive process. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ModificationOutsideTransactionException](8f025460-c283-ea99-aa8a-5a36e11528f4.htm) | The document has no open transaction. |
