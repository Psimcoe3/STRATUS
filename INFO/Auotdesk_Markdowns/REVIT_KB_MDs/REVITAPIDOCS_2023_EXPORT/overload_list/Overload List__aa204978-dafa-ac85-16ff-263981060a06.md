| Public method Static member | [Create(Curve)](da8be410-f630-3384-e203-32b81cd0e90c.htm) | Construct BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry based on any GCurve, including GLine and GArc. The curve will be simplified if possible, and the concrete type of the returned value will reflect that simplification: BRepBuilderLinearEdgeGeometry if the curve could be simplified to a line, BRepBuilderArcEdgeGeometry if it could be simplified to an arc, BRepBuilderGenericCurveEdgeGeometry otherwise. |
| Public method Static member | [Create(XYZ, XYZ)](f2d295f0-1ff9-a8c4-d723-6e521fcbab9c.htm) | Constructs a BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry representing a straight line between the two given points. |
