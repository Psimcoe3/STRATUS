# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public int NumberOfNormals { get; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public ReadOnly Property NumberOfNormals As Integer 	Get ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property int NumberOfNormals { 	int get (); } ``` |

# Remarks

The number is always equal either to '1', or the number of facets, or the number of points. The DistributionOfNormals property indicates how normals are distributed along the polymesh. If there is only one normal available, it applies to the entire mesh. Curved surfaces have normal vectors associated with either every facet or every point/vertex of the tessellated polymesh.
