# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void SetPointElementReference( 	PointElementReference pointElementReference ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub SetPointElementReference ( _ 	pointElementReference As PointElementReference _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public: void SetPointElementReference( 	PointElementReference^ pointElementReference ) ``` |

#### Parameters

pointElementReference
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB PointElementReference](f1548185-45ba-c1c6-8bde-4f9bb0669026.htm)    
     An object specifying a rule for the location and orientation of a ReferencePoint. (Note: The ReferencePoint object does not store the pointElementReference object after this call.)

# Remarks

pointElementReference may be    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  , in which case the ReferencePoint does not follow any other element. When Reference is changed from    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  to a non-null value, the point moves and rotates to the prescribed location and orientation. Where the coordinate system has some freedom, it will remain as close to the old orientation as possible. When the reference is set to    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  , the point does not move or rotate.

# Exceptions
