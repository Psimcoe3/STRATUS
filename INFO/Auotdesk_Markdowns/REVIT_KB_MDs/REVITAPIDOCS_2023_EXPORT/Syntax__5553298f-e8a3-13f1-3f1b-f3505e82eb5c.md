| [WorksharingUtils Class](ae7857a0-4e9b-f9c1-84c7-8b250af68068.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Obtains ownership for the current user of as many specified elements as possible.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static ICollection<ElementId> CheckoutElements( 	Document document, 	ICollection<ElementId> elementsToCheckout ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CheckoutElements ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	elementsToCheckout As ICollection(Of ElementId) _ ) As ICollection(Of ElementId) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static ICollection<ElementId^>^ CheckoutElements( 	Document^ document,  	ICollection<ElementId^>^ elementsToCheckout ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document containing the elements.

elementsToCheckout
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic ICollection   [ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The ids of the elements to attempt to check out.

#### Return Value

The ids of all specified elements that are now owned (but possibly out of date), including all that were owned prior to the function call.

# Remarks

For best performance, checkout all elements in one big call, rather than many small calls.

Revit may check out additional elements that are needed to check out the elements you requested. For example, if you request an element that is in a group, Revit will check out the entire group.

When there comes a contention error when locking the central model, this API would wait and retry endlessly until getting the lock of the central model.

```
void CheckoutAllRooms(Document doc)
{
    FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);
    ICollection<ElementId> rooms = collector.WherePasses(new RoomFilter()).ToElementIds();
    ICollection<ElementId> checkoutelements = WorksharingUtils.CheckoutElements(doc, rooms);
    TaskDialog.Show("Checked out elements", "Number of elements checked out: " + checkoutelements.Count);
}
```

```
Private Sub CheckoutAllRooms(doc As Document)
    Dim collector As New FilteredElementCollector(doc)
    Dim rooms As ICollection(Of ElementId) = collector.WherePasses(New RoomFilter()).ToElementIds()
    Dim checkoutelements As ICollection(Of ElementId) = WorksharingUtils.CheckoutElements(doc, rooms)
    TaskDialog.Show("Checked out elements", "Number of elements checked out: " + checkoutelements.Count)
End Sub
