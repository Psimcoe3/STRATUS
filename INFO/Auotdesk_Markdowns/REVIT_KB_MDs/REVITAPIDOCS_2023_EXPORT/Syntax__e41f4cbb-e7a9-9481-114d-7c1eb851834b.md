| Enabled | For a structural column, enables rigid link formation, unless the neighboring structural beam overrides the setting. For a structural beam, enables rigid link formation, overriding the neighboring structural column's setting. |
| Disabled | For a structural column, this disables rigid Link formation, unless the neighboring structural beam overrides the setting. For a structural beam, this disables rigid Link formation, overriding the neighboring structural column's setting. |
| FromColumn | For a structural beam, this indicates that the structural column setting should be used to determine rigid link formation. This value is not applicable to structural columns. |

# Remarks

Rigid Links are curves connecting neighboring Structural Beams and Structural Columns.
