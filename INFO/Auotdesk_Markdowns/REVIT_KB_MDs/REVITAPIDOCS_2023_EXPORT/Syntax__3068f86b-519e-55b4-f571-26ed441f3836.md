Moves a point in a TopographySurface to a new designated location.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture](720f0c58-cb2b-4f13-374a-7348ed0a1cd3.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void MovePoint( 	XYZ movedPoint, 	XYZ targetPoint ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub MovePoint ( _ 	movedPoint As XYZ, _ 	targetPoint As XYZ _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void MovePoint( 	XYZ^ movedPoint,  	XYZ^ targetPoint ) ``` |

#### Parameters

movedPoint
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The point to be moved.

targetPoint
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The new designated location of this point will move to.

# Remarks

If targetPt exists, the movedPt will be deleted. That means if movedPoint is moved to become a duplicate of an existing point, movedPoint will be deleted instead becuase both points cannot exist at the same location. This applies to a TopographySurface element (not a SiteSubRegion or a topography surface associated with a BuildingPad), which shoule be in an active TopographyEditScope.

# Exceptions
