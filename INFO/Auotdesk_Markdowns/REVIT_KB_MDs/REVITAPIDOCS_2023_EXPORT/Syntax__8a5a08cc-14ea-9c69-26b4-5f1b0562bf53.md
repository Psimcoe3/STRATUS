Creates a copy of a definition shape that was created earlier.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static IList<GeometryObject> CreateGeometryInstance( 	Document document, 	string definition_id, 	Transform trf ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateGeometryInstance ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	definition_id As String, _ 	trf As Transform _ ) As IList(Of GeometryObject) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static IList<GeometryObject^>^ CreateGeometryInstance( 	Document^ document,  	String^ definition_id,  	Transform^ trf ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     Document to which the created element will be added

definition\_id
:   Type:  System String    
     ID of the shape definition that was created earlier and stored via DirectShapeLibrary

trf
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Transform](58dd01c8-b3fc-7142-e4f3-c524079a282d.htm)    
     Transform to be applied to the definition

#### Return Value

A collection of GeometryObjects representing a placed instance of the pre-defined shape The caller function takes ownership

# Remarks

Use DirectShapeLibrary class to store definitions prior to using them here. How the definitions are stored will determine whether an instance or a copy of the shape will be created. Use the output of this function as input to CreateElement to make the created shape persistent. This is intended to support a definition/instance pattern common in CAD formats - DWG blocks, STEP MAPPED\_ITEM, IFC IfcMappedItem.
