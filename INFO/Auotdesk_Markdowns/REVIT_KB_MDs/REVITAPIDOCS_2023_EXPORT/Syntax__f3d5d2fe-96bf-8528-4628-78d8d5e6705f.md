#### Field Value

This value may be if the object does not store a corresponding reference. This might be due to any of the following reasons:

* The face was obtained from an API member which does not permit options to generate corresponding References (most API members, besides Element.Geometry, do not have an option to generate a Reference).
* The corresponding geometry object does not permit referencing.
