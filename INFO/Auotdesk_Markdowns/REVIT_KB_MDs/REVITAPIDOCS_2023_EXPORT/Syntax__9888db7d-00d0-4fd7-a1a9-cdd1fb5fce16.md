| ElementType | A type parameter of the scheduled elements. |
| Count | The number of elements appearing on the schedule row. |
| ViewBased | A specialized type of field used for a few parameters whose displayed values can change based on the settings of the view:   * ROOM\_AREA and ROOM\_PERIMETER in room and space schedules. * PROJECT\_REVISION\_REVISION\_NUM in revision schedules. * KEYNOTE\_NUMBER in keynote legends that are numbered by sheet. |
| Formula | A formula calculated from the values of other fields in the schedule. |
| Percentage | A value indicating what percent of the total of another field each element represents. |
| Room | A parameter of the room that a scheduled element belongs to. |
| FromRoom | A parameter of the room on the "from" side of a door or window. |
