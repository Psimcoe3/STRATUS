# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public enum RebarConstraintTargetHostFaceType ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Enumeration RebarConstraintTargetHostFaceType ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public enum class RebarConstraintTargetHostFaceType ``` |

# Members

| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| FaceWithTagId | Face identified by integer tag. |
| Top | Face forms the top surface of the host geometry. |
| Bottom | Face forms the bottom surface of the host geometry. |
| End0 | Face forms the starting end surface of the host geometry. |
| End1 | Face forms the end surface of the host geometry. |
| Side0 | Face forms the exterior surface of the host geometry. |
| Side1 | Face forms the interior surface of the host geometry. |

# Remarks

For some types of host, it is possible to describe the face in terms of recognizable topology (i.e. Top, Bottom, etc.). However, for most elements, the face can only be identified by integer tag. In all cases, a Pick to the host face can be obtained by calling RebarConstraint.GetTargetHostFaceReference().
