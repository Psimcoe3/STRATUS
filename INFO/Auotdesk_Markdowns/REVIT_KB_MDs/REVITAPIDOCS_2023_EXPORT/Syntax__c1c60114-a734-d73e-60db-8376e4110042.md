| ``` public void SetFromCurves( 	RebarStyle style, 	RebarBarType barType, 	RebarHookType startHook, 	RebarHookType endHook, 	XYZ norm, 	IList<Curve> curves, 	RebarHookOrientation startHookOrient, 	RebarHookOrientation endHookOrient, 	bool useExistingShapeIfPossible, 	bool createNewShape ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub SetFromCurves ( _ 	style As RebarStyle, _ 	barType As RebarBarType, _ 	startHook As RebarHookType, _ 	endHook As RebarHookType, _ 	norm As XYZ, _ 	curves As IList(Of Curve), _ 	startHookOrient As RebarHookOrientation, _ 	endHookOrient As RebarHookOrientation, _ 	useExistingShapeIfPossible As Boolean, _ 	createNewShape As Boolean _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public: void SetFromCurves( 	RebarStyle style,  	RebarBarType^ barType,  	RebarHookType^ startHook,  	RebarHookType^ endHook,  	XYZ^ norm,  	IList<Curve^>^ curves,  	RebarHookOrientation startHookOrient,  	RebarHookOrientation endHookOrient,  	bool useExistingShapeIfPossible,  	bool createNewShape ) ``` |

#### Parameters

style
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarStyle](a9ac65a6-29e6-25e5-caca-502e21385f47.htm)    
     The usage of the bar, "standard" or "stirrup/tie".

barType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarBarType](467b44cc-54e7-3ecf-07e1-ad15d05fe800.htm)    
     A RebarBarType element that defines bar diameter, bend radius and material of the rebar.

startHook
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.htm)    
     A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the start of the bar. If this parameter is    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  , it means to create a rebar with no hook.

endHook
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.htm)    
     A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the end of the bar. If this parameter is    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  , it means to create a rebar with no hook.

norm
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The normal to the plane that the rebar curves lie on.

curves
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     An array of curves that define the shape of the rebar curves. They must belong to the plane defined by the normal and origin. Bends and hooks should not be included in the array of curves.

startHookOrient
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.htm)    
     Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the start of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the first curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up."

endHookOrient
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.htm)    
     Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the end of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the last curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up."

useExistingShapeIfPossible
:   Type:  System Boolean    
     Attempts to assign a RebarShape from those existing in the document. If no shape matches, NewRebar returns or creates a new shape, according to the parameter createNewShape. When both parameters are "true", the behavior is the same as sketching rebar in the UI. At least one of these parameters must be "true". If the RebarShapeDefinesHooks flag in ReinforcementSettings has been set to false, and a RebarShape cannot be found with both matching curves and hooks, then this method will perform a second search, ignoring hook information.

createNewShape
:   Type:  System Boolean    
     Creates a shape in the document to match the curves, hooks, and style specified, and assigns it to the new rebar instance. Shape creation will not succeed unless one or more other shapes already exist in the document, and these shapes have enough shape parameters to define a shape for these curves.

# Exceptions
