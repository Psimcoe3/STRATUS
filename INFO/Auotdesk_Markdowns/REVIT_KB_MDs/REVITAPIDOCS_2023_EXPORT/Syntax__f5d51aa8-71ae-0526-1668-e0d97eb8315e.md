# Remarks

Since the  [!:PDFExportOptions.FileName]  is not serialized, when  [!:Combine]  is     true  (  True  in Visual Basic)  (which means all the views would be exported into one PDF file, whose file name is specified by  [!:PDFExportOptions.FileName]  ), the returned  [PDFExportOptions](e4236fc8-f8e7-fc74-1b81-9e3a4d9e966b.htm)  would have  [!:PDFExportOptions.FileName]  as an empty string. The user has to set the  [!:PDFExportOptions.FileName]  before calling the  [!:Document.Export(string, IList{ElementId}, PDFExportOption)]  API exporting a "combined" PDF file.
