# Remarks

A particular group can be found by Name, using the Item property on the DefinitionGroups object. A new group can be created by using the Create method on the DefinitionGroups Object. The Create method takes the name of the new group, as a string, as its input parameter, returning a reference to a new definition group object as its result.
