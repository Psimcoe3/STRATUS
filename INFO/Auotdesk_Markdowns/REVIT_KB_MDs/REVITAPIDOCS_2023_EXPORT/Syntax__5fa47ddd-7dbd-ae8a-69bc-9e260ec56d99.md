| ``` public static TopographySurface Create( 	Document document, 	IList<XYZ> points, 	IList<PolymeshFacet> facets ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	points As IList(Of XYZ), _ 	facets As IList(Of PolymeshFacet) _ ) As TopographySurface ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static TopographySurface^ Create( 	Document^ document,  	IList<XYZ^>^ points,  	IList<PolymeshFacet^>^ facets ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document to be modified.

points
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     A collection of points. The points represent an enclosed area in the XY plane.

facets
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [PolymeshFacet](a7315aaf-631d-96af-368c-65f86b6c00ef.htm)    
     Triangle facets composing a polygon mesh. Every facet contains 3 integers representing vertex indices.

#### Return Value

The new topography surface.

# Remarks

The document will be regenerated during the creation of this topography surface element. The topography surface created by facet cannot modify its triangle points and facets.

# Exceptions
