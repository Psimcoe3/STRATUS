# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public ISet<ElementId> GetLabeledDimensions() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetLabeledDimensions As ISet(Of ElementId) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: ISet<ElementId^>^ GetLabeledDimensions() ``` |

#### Return Value

Collection of Element Ids.

# Remarks

In case of a reporting parameter the returned collection will contain at most one element - the driving dimension, if it has been set already. It is because reporting parameters may have only one dimension labeled. For non-reporting parameters the set would contain all dimensions that have been labeled by this global parameter.
