Indicates if it is possible to create parts from this DirectShape element.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 21.0.0.0 (21.1.1.109)   
  **Since:**  2020

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool CanCreateParts() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function CanCreateParts As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool CanCreateParts() ``` |

#### Return Value

True if it is possible to create parts from this DirectShape.

# Remarks

While it is generally possible to create parts from DirectShape elements, some characteristics make parts creation impossible. This property is re-evaluated every time the element's geometry is modified (via a call to SetShape or AppendShape). Invalid configurations include: DirectShape elements containing a polymesh, or an open geometry, as well as DirectShape elements not containing any solids and DirectShape elements configured as NotReferenceable (via a call to SetOptions). Finally, if a DirectShape element has DirectShapeType instances in its geometry, and one of those DirectShapeTypes has a configuration that is incompatible with parts creation, the DirectShape element will also be incompatible with parts creation.
