# Remarks

This id can be passed to obtain the element from Document.Element[string] property, but any element obtained through this method may no longer be a valid or up-to-date model element. The originating CAD object is only accurate and up-to-date at the time of creation of the energy model. If the originating element belongs to a linked document, the unique id of the link obtained from CADLinkUniqueId should be used to access it.
