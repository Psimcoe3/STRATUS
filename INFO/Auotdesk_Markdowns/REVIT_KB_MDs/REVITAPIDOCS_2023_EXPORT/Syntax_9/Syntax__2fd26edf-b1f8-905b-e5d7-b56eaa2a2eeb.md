#### Parameters

accountId
:   Type:  System Guid    
     The BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs account Id. You can use one of the following methods to get this Id:

    * If you get the hub Id with Forge Data Management API, remove the prefix "b." of the Id string and convert the rest to a Guid.
    * If you get the account Id with Forge BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs API, just convert the Id string to a Guid.

projectId
:   Type:  System Guid    
     The BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs project Id. You can use one of the following methods to get this Id:

    * If you get the project Id with Forge Data Management API, remove the prefix "b." of the Id string and convert the rest to a Guid.
    * If you get the project Id with Forge BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs API, just convert the Id string to a Guid.

folderId
:   Type:  System String    
     Folder identity in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs to save the model. You can use one of the following methods to get this Id:

    * The folder Id string from Forge Data Management API.
    * The folder Id string from Forge BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs API.

modelName
:   Type:  System String    
     Model name in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs to save the model.

# Remarks

Assumes that user is currently signed in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs and has access to Autodesk cloud services. This operation will create a model on cloud and then create a local cache of the cloud model. This method cannot be used when current document is already in cloud.

You can use one of the following methods to save a local model as a workshared cloud model in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs.

* If the local model is a workshared model, then it will be a workshared cloud model after you use this method successfully.
* If the local model is a non-workshared model, you can enable the workset with  [EnableWorksharing(String, String)](7c29717e-1d8c-4e02-20ad-65c53ea8eaaa.htm)  and then save as a workshared cloud model.
* If the local model is a non-workshared model, and you have already saved it as a non-workshared cloud model in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs, you can still enable the workset with  [EnableCloudWorksharing](4146e816-565e-85d8-ce94-93ec505a0924.htm)  to convert it to a workshared cloud model.

You cannot save a local workshared model as a non-workshared cloud model in BIM 360 Docs or Autodesk Docs.
