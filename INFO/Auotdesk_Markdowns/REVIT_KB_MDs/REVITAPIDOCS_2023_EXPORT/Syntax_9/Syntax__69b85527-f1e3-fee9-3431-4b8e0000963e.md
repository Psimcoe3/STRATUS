Reports a bounding box of the geometry that this server submits for drawing.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.DirectContext3D](f4ba10f0-55ea-5344-173b-688405391794.htm)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` Outline GetBoundingBox( 	View dBView ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Function GetBoundingBox ( _ 	dBView As View _ ) As Outline ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` Outline^ GetBoundingBox( 	View^ dBView ) ``` |

#### Parameters

dBView
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.htm)    
     The view where rendering will occur. If this argument is    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  , a view-independent bounding box should be reported.

#### Return Value

The bounding box as an Outline.

# Remarks

Revit uses the bounding box when navigating views, e.g., when a Zoom to Fit command is issued. The reported bounding box does not have to be tight. However, there may be unintended side-effects if the box is inconsistent with the submitted geometry.
