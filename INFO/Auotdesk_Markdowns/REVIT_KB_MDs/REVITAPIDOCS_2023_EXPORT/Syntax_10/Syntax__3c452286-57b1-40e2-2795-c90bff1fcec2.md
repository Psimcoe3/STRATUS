# Remarks

BoundingBoxXYZ objects are used in Revit in several places related to views (for example, the section box of a 3D view or the definition of a section or detail view). BoundingBoxXYZ objects can also be obtained from elements representing the boundary of the element in a given view.

The extents of the box are determined by three orthogonal planes extended through the minimum (  [Min](608e6914-2465-b572-2c5d-2a6cd696c740.htm)  ) and maximum (  [Max](b79bd9ee-ccff-cc81-8a32-9eb9bdb1e58c.htm)  ) points, but the coordinates of these points and the orientation of the planes in relation to the coordinates of the source model is determined by the box Transform (  [Transform](297887ab-69bb-548e-cfb6-a3a23f410604.htm)  ).

This class also has the ability to detect and mark certain extents as disabled. Note that in the current Revit API uses of this class it is not expected that Revit will give objects with disabled extents, and disabled extents in objects sent to Revit will likely be ignored.

Note: the bounding box may not be empty even if Element::Geometry::get returns nothing. This can happen if the element contains no 3D model geometry since by default, Element::Geometry::get only returns 3D model geometry while GeometryElement::GetBoundingBox also takes 2D plan-view geometry and elevation-view geometry into account.

    if (view3D.IsSectionBoxActive)
    {
        BoundingBoxXYZ sectionBox = view3D.GetSectionBox();

        // Note that the section box can be rotated and transformed.  
        // So the min/max corners coordinates relative to the model must be computed via the transform.
        Transform trf = sectionBox.Transform;

        XYZ max = sectionBox.Max; //Maximum coordinates (upper-right-front corner of the box before transform is applied).
        XYZ min = sectionBox.Min; //Minimum coordinates (lower-left-rear corner of the box before transform is applied).

        // Transform the min and max to model coordinates
        XYZ maxInModelCoords = trf.OfPoint(max);
        XYZ minInModelCoords = trf.OfPoint(min);

        message += "\nView has an active section box: ";
