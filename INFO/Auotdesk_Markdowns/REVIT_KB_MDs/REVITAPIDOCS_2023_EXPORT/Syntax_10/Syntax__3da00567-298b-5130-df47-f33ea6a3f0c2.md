# Syntax

| C# |

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function SortPoints ( _ 	arr As ReferencePointArray _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public: static bool SortPoints( 	ReferencePointArray^ arr ) ``` |

#### Parameters

arr
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ReferencePointArray](4780adea-9e68-b0b4-09c7-68f7752dd650.htm)    
     An array of ReferencePoints. The array is reordered if sortPoints returns true, and is unchanged if sortPoints returns false.

False if the least-squares method is unable to find a solution; true otherwise.

# Remarks

Finds a best-fit line to the points by the least squares method, and orders the points by their projection onto the line.
