# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public FlexDuct NewFlexDuct( 	Connector connector, 	IList<XYZ> points, 	FlexDuctType ductType ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function NewFlexDuct ( _ 	connector As Connector, _ 	points As IList(Of XYZ), _ 	ductType As FlexDuctType _ ) As FlexDuct ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: FlexDuct^ NewFlexDuct( 	Connector^ connector,  	IList<XYZ^>^ points,  	FlexDuctType^ ductType ) ``` |

#### Parameters

connector
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.htm)    
     The connector to be connected to the duct, including the end points.

points
:   Type:  [System.Collections.Generic IList](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5y536ey6)   [XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The point array indicating the path of the flexible duct.

ductType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Mechanical FlexDuctType](cd9a7d63-9b1b-921f-f3ec-b2ec862eb2f2.htm)    
     The type of the flexible duct.

#### Return Value

If creation was successful then a new flexible duct is returned, otherwise an exception with failure information will be thrown.

# Remarks

If the connector is a fitting or equipment connector of the correct domain, and if the connector's direction matches the direction of the flexible duct to be created, the connectors will be automatically connected. A transition fitting will be added at the connector(s) if necessary. If the connector's type, domain, does not match the one of the input connector, no connection will be established.

# Exceptions
