# Remarks

Only the current family type is editable using the methods in  [FamilyManager](1cc4fe6c-0e9f-7439-0021-32d2e06f4c33.htm)  . If you want to modify the properties of any family type, it must be set to be the current type first. This value will be    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  if there is no type in the family. In order to modify parameter values, you will need to create one using  [NewType(String)](b46e98b1-54a1-7e04-66b7-a35efe5bc3f8.htm)  .
