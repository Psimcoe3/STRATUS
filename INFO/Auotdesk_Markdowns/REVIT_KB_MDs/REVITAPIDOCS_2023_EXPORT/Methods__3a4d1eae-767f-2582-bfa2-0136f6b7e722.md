# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [AddBarGeometry(IList Curve )](674f12da-e4a0-fc7f-b011-a706c7859d40.htm) | Adds a new rebar geometry. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| Public method | [AddBarGeometry(CurveLoop)](9948f497-0cdc-b3b6-a465-b7fe4e843da2.htm) | Adds a new rebar geometry. This information is set to the rebar after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| Public method | [CanAddBarGeometry](4dc39ffe-585f-9f4f-725c-5269d71bfc1e.htm) | Returns true if getNumberOfBarGeometry() is less than GetNumberOfBars(), false otherwise. |
| Public method | [ClearAllAddedBarGeometry](f1450c93-30ed-79cf-0acd-3619cb170428.htm) | This function will remove all bars geometry that were added by calling AddBarGeometry(). |
| Public method | [CreateEndConstraint](30f97bb3-ad2e-6240-6222-afa70754f1f3.htm) | Creates a constraint for the end handle of the rebar. This constraint will be set preferred after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| Public method | [CreateStartConstraint](d4a71afa-9ebd-fc3d-6b74-79180843f086.htm) | Creates a constraint for the start handle of the rebar. This constraint will be set preferred after the API execution is finished successfully. |
| Public method | [Dispose](030e9c7c-7be8-8554-751e-9cffc4264b8b.htm) | Releases all resources used by the  [RebarTrimExtendData](980b816d-dc7e-7550-3e37-61482516b5ab.htm) |

| Public method | [GetAddedBarGeometry](64c06ae1-86b7-4e86-94df-2a6d99084a11.htm) | Gets the added curves that will represent the bar at index barIndex. |
| Public method | [GetHashCode](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zdee4b3y) | Serves as a hash function for a particular type. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
| Public method | [GetNumberOfBarGeometry](58c19b83-13ae-de95-4950-aefa2873f687.htm) | Gets the number of Bar Geometry that were added. |
| Public method | [GetRebarUpdateCurvesData](64b5059a-5cfe-bf9a-b13c-dea51ff40449.htm) | Gets a class that contains information used as input and output for rebar free form calculation. |
| Public method | [GetType](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dfwy45w9) | Gets the  [Type](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/42892f65)  of the current instance. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
