     The key of the FailureMessage to be deleted.

# Remarks

If code that previously has posted a failure is executed again or otherwise detects that failure conditions do not exist anymore and the failure is not longer relevant, it should delete a failure message in order to let transaction to be committed. In order to delete the failure, it should invoke this method with a message key that was returned when the failure was posted.
