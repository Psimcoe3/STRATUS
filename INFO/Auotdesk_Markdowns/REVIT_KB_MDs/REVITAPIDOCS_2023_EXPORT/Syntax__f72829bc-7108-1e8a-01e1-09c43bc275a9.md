Creates a solid by linearly extruding one or more closed coplanar curve loops.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static Solid CreateExtrusionGeometry( 	IList<CurveLoop> profileLoops, 	XYZ extrusionDir, 	double extrusionDist, 	SolidOptions solidOptions ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateExtrusionGeometry ( _ 	profileLoops As IList(Of CurveLoop), _ 	extrusionDir As XYZ, _ 	extrusionDist As Double, _ 	solidOptions As SolidOptions _ ) As Solid ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static Solid^ CreateExtrusionGeometry( 	IList<CurveLoop^>^ profileLoops,  	XYZ^ extrusionDir,  	double extrusionDist,  	SolidOptions^ solidOptions ) ``` |

#### Parameters

profileLoops
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)    
     The profile loops to be extruded. The loops must be closed, coplanar, and without intersections, self-intersections, or degeneracies. No loop may contain just one closed curve - split such loops into two or more curves beforehand. No conditions are imposed on the orientations of the loops: this function will use copies of the input loops that have been oriented as necessary to conform to Revit's orientation conventions.

extrusionDir
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The direction in which to extrude the profile loops. This vector must be non-zero and transverse (i.e., not parallel) to the plane of the profile loops. Its length is irrelevant; only its direction is used.

extrusionDist
:   Type:  System Double    
     The positive distance by which the loops are to be extruded in the direction of the input extrusionDir.

solidOptions
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB SolidOptions](75d6caeb-62d1-d31f-47fe-618ac7cedf19.htm)    
     The optional information to control the properties of the Solid.

#### Return Value

The requested solid.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The profile CurveLoops do not satisfy the input requirements. -or- The Input extrusionDir must be a non-zero vector. The normal of the loop plane should not be perpendicular to the given extrusionDir. -or- The input argument extrusionDist must be positive. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
