| --- |
| ``` public double Height { get; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public ReadOnly Property Height As Double 	Get ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

# Remarks

The value is in sheet units, meaning it is as when measured on a printed sheet. The measurement is of the text content only; the border around it (if specified) is excluded.

This is a read-only property, for the height of the text area is calculated depending on the text content and its wrapping.
