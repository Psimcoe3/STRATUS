| [SiteSubRegion Class](98cf9a80-873e-3703-5a95-a87672adf383.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Identifies whether the given curve loops compose a valid boundary.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture](720f0c58-cb2b-4f13-374a-7348ed0a1cd3.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static bool IsValidBoundary( 	IList<CurveLoop> curveLoops ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function IsValidBoundary ( _ 	curveLoops As IList(Of CurveLoop) _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static bool IsValidBoundary( 	IList<CurveLoop^>^ curveLoops ) ``` |

#### Parameters

curveLoops
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)    
     The curve loops to be checked.

#### Return Value

True if the given curve loops don't intersect with each other; each curve loop is closed; and each loop is planar and lies on a plane parallel to the horizontal(XY) plane. Any requirement above is not satisfied or no curve loops contained, returns false.

# Remarks

The curve loops are valid if they don't intersect with each other; each curve loop is closed; and each loop is planar and lies on a plane parallel to the horizontal(XY) plane.
