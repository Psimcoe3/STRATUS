# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static CurveUV Create( 	Curve curve3D ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	curve3D As Curve _ ) As CurveUV ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static CurveUV^ Create( 	Curve^ curve3D ) ``` |

#### Parameters

curve3D
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The input bounded 3D Curve lying in the XY plane (i.e., z = 0 everywhere along the curve).

#### Return Value

The newly created CurveUV.

# Remarks

The XY plane is identified with the uv parameter space of the surface to which this SurfParamSpaceCurve refers.
