| [CurveElement Class](61673852-2d08-003d-e9fd-4be89d533774.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Geometry curve of the curve element.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public Curve GeometryCurve { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property GeometryCurve As Curve 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property Curve^ GeometryCurve { 	Curve^ get (); 	void set (Curve^ value); } ``` |

# Remarks

When setting this property, any curves that this curve is currently joined to will affect the result - the final geometry of this curve and of the joined curves may change. To avoid the effect of existing joins, use  [SetGeometryCurve(Curve, Boolean)](9deec90c-4efc-9aa6-245d-061669022aa2.htm)  with true passed ot overrideJoins. After the curve geometry is set, other nearby curves may join to the new curve geometry.
