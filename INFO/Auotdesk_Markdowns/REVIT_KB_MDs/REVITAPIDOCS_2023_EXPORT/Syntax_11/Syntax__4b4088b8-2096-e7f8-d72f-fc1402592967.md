Returns the signed volume of this solid.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double Volume { get; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public ReadOnly Property Volume As Double 	Get ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property double Volume { 	double get (); } ``` |

#### Return Value

The real number equal to the signed volume of this solid.

# Remarks

Revit attempts to compute the volume analytically, if possible. If an analytical solution is not possible, it uses tessellated faces to calculate a reasonable approximation for the volume. The calculated volume may be slightly underestimated or overestimated if curved surfaces are present.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | Thrown when this solid is not a valid Geometry object or the volume calculation failed. |
