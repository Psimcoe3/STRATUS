# Remarks

controls whether the Model Family Element is shown when a FamilyInstance of that Family is cut in a Plan/RCP view, i.e. the cut plane passes through the bounding box of the instance. It only has a meaning for categories that are "cut in the symbol". For non-cuttable categories it is always false and for ones that are "cuttable in the instance" it is the same as the IsShownInTopBottom.
