     Id of the face.

# Remarks

No functions that modify the given face's definition should be called after calling this function (e.g.,  [AddLoop(BRepBuilderGeometryId)](169a75b9-2b82-09ec-a6f1-a9b82e8f32fe.htm)  ,  [SetFaceMaterialId(BRepBuilderGeometryId, ElementId)](8b7c7bed-57ef-a1e0-0fe2-529fe742e64a.htm)  ). The BRepBuilder may take the opportunity to validate some of the face's data and report any problems it finds.
