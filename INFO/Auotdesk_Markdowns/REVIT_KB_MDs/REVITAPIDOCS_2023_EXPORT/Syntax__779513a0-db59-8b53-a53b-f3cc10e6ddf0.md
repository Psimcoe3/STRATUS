Determines if this edge's topological direction on the Face is opposite to its parametric direction.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 21.0.0.0 (21.1.1.109)   
  **Since:**  2021

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool IsFlippedOnFace( 	int index ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function IsFlippedOnFace ( _ 	index As Integer _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool IsFlippedOnFace( 	int index ) ``` |

#### Parameters

index
:   Type:  System Int32    
     The index of the face (0 or 1).

#### Return Value

true if this edge's topological direction on the Face is opposite to its parametric direction, false if the topological direction agrees with the parametric direction.

# Remarks

Outer edge loops on a Face are oriented counter-clockwise with respect to the Face's orientation, and inner loops are oriented clockwise. The topological direction of an edge on a face means the direction in which the edge's loop is being traversed.

# Exceptions

| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm) | Thrown when the specified index is not 0 or 1. |
