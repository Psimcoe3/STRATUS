| [TransactionGroup Class](f1113d30-4c36-7844-1537-aad7f095cea0.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Commits the transaction group.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2011

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public TransactionStatus Commit() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Commit As TransactionStatus ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: TransactionStatus Commit() ``` |

#### Return Value

If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Committed.

# Remarks

Committing a group does not change the model. It only confirms the commitment of all inner groups and transactions.

Commit can be called only when all inner transaction groups and transactions are finished, i.e. after they were either committed or rolled back. If there is still a transaction or an inner transaction group open, an attempt to commit this outer group will cause an exception.

         // For our compound operation to be considered successful, both the individual
         // transactions must succeed. If either one fails, we will roll our group back,
         // regardless of what transactions might have already been committed.

            // transactions. They will stay available on the undo menu and may still be undone
            // individually. If it is not desirable if one transaction from a multi-transaction
            // operation can be undone by th end user, then the transaction group must be
            // assimilated instead of committed. See TransactionGroup.Assimilate for details.
