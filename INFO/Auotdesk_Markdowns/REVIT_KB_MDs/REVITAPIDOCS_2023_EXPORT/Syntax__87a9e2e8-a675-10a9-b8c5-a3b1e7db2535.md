| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` bool IsResourceWellFormed( 	ExternalResourceReference^ extRef ) ``` |

#### Parameters

extRef
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ExternalResourceReference](ffad9c15-8fc9-fbfd-f328-101533f4cf74.htm)    
     The ExternalResourceReference to check.

#### Return Value

True if the ExternalResourceReference represents a well-formed resource. False otherwise.

# Remarks

Different servers will have different requirements.

A server which loads references from a website might require that the reference map contain a key called "URL" and a value that is a valid URL.

A server which loads references from a network drive might require a key called "Drive" with a value that represents a drive name, plus a key called "Path" with a value that corresponds to a path relative to the root of the drive.

This function should not check that the resource exists on the server. It should only check that the resource is formatted correctly.
