# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public property | [AreWorkshopInstructionsChanged](4edc3d5e-dd8c-5549-6766-03319c538b7c.htm) | Indicates if the workshop instructions have changed since the last regeneration. |
| Public property | [ErrorMessage](858682bf-3961-9f2b-c515-6b6178ca7f36.htm) | The reason for calculation failure. If the calculation fails, this message will be shown in an error, or warning if we are editing the constraints. |
| Public property | [HostMirrored](7e5256ff-5025-9091-5056-c2261eadbc71.htm) | If true, then host of the rebar was mirrorred (along with the rebar) before this regeneration. |
| Public property | [IsAttachmentTypeChanged](a4e69222-df6f-43e8-d771-8057ede14f59.htm) | Indicates if the attachment type has changed since the last regeneration. |
| Public property | [IsBarsNumberChanged](f9c25fd6-9a2b-3256-87f5-5263b81b50ae.htm) | Indicates if the bar number has changed since the last regeneration. |
| Public property | [IsBendingRadiusChanged](b2d9fe7c-8574-cbd1-649b-f85e323c9023.htm) | Indicates if the bending radius has changed since the last regeneration. |
| Public property | [IsEndConstraintChanged](e0f39d9d-c6f6-6171-2417-f8955fd9df48.htm) | Indicates if the end handle constraint has changed since the last regeneration. |
| Public property | [IsLayoutChanged](e899e410-1146-0999-bcf7-9c2654edf8cd.htm) | Indicates if the layout has changed since the last regeneration. |
| Public property | [IsReversed](e58025cb-84de-5dd2-afe6-92d811500f16.htm) | Used to store the state of the bar refering to the direction of the bars. This is useful when using face intersection to calculate bars. After mirroring, curves created from intersecting faces may be reversed, so we use this to store the state and keep the rebar pointing in the correct direction. |
| Public property | [IsSpacingChanged](a0777387-3afd-8563-8787-df3b09f68b8f.htm) | Indicates if the spacing has changed since the last regeneration. |
| Public property | [IsStartConstraintChanged](8d7fd7b3-4a9a-bd4a-0dbd-83a7842e4e1b.htm) | Indicates if the start handle constraint has changed since the last regeneration. |
| Public property | [IsStyleChanged](f3703d7b-9bbc-3e47-2cf8-d859018f29a0.htm) | Indicates if the style has changed since the last regeneration. |
| Public property | [IsValidObject](d2640a19-317e-b66d-c8e5-47a321eca59e.htm) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
| Public property | [Spacing](56add314-9f76-d2bd-afa7-fa9fed067ef3.htm) | The spacing between the bars, according to the LayoutRule. |
| Public property | [WorkshopInstructions](6daee31b-85cf-d7f0-1c96-13d3a13a3bc0.htm) | Identifies the workshop instructions of this rebar. |
