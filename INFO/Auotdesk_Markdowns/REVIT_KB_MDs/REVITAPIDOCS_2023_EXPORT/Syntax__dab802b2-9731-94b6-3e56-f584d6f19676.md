#### Parameters

familyInstance
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.htm)    
     The FamilyInstance, which must be of a structural framing category.

end
:   Type:  System Int32    
     The index of the end (0 for the start, 1 for the end).

# Remarks

If that end is near other elements it will become joined as a result. By default all framing elements are allowed to join at ends, so this function is only needed if this element end is already disallowed to join.
