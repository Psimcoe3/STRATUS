# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void ShowActiveWorkPlane() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub ShowActiveWorkPlane ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public: void ShowActiveWorkPlane() ``` |

# Remarks

If this method is invoked while the current work plane is hidden, only the outline of the updated work plane will be shown immediately. The updated sketch plane will be shown fully after the current transaction is committed. Therefore it is recommended the Add-On commits the transaction before performing UI operations (for example, PickPoint).
