| [CurveElement Class](61673852-2d08-003d-e9fd-4be89d533774.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Sets the sketch plane and the curve for this CurveElement.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 17.0.0.0 (17.0.1090.0)   
  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void SetSketchPlaneAndCurve( 	SketchPlane sketchPlane, 	Curve curve ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub SetSketchPlaneAndCurve ( _ 	sketchPlane As SketchPlane, _ 	curve As Curve _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void SetSketchPlaneAndCurve( 	SketchPlane^ sketchPlane,  	Curve^ curve ) ``` |

#### Parameters

sketchPlane
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB SketchPlane](ba104029-d175-7e75-caef-667a4281f4af.htm)    
     The new sketch plane.

curve
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The new curve.

# Remarks

Unlike the setters of  [SketchPlane](e8c6a9e9-e048-d750-2951-6f45ac7f350d.htm)  and  [GeometryCurve](713ec948-c85c-24fa-0668-c2c2bbdc4c73.htm)  , this method will reset relationships between the two properties and with other elements. To set a geometry curve which belongs to a sketch-based elements, use  [GeometryCurve](713ec948-c85c-24fa-0668-c2c2bbdc4c73.htm)

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | Thrown if the argument is    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  . |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | Thrown if the CurveElement is CurveByPoints or belongs to a Path3d element. -- or -- Thrown if the sketch plane is set on a DetailCurve. -- or -- Thrown if the sketch plane is not suitable. -- or -- Thrown if the CurveElement belongs to a sketch-based element. -- or -- Thrown if modifying the sketch plane is not allowed. -- or -- Thrown if the CurveElement cannot be moved out of its sketch plane. -- or -- Thrown if the input curve is of a type different from the current. -- or -- Thrown if the input curve is bound and the current is not or vice versa. -- or -- Thrown if the input curve is helical. -- or -- Thrown if the input curve lies outside of the SketchPlane of the current curve. |
