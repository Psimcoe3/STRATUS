# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public CurveLoop GetBendProfileWithFillets() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetBendProfileWithFillets As CurveLoop ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: CurveLoop^ GetBendProfileWithFillets() ``` |

#### Return Value

The bend profile with generated fillets that defines the shape of the fabric sheet bending for bent fabric sheet, for flat fabric sheet    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  will be returned.

# Remarks

Returned curve loop is created automatically as a result of adding fillets to bend profile. The returned profile defines the center-curve of a wire. Note that bent Fabric Sheets can have planar geometry, but flat Fabric Sheets are always planar.
