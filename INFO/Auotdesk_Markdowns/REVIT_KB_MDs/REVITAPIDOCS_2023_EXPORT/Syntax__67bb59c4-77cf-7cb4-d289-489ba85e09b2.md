Returns whether the model in the current session is up to date with central.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool HasAllChangesFromCentral() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function HasAllChangesFromCentral As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool HasAllChangesFromCentral() ``` |

#### Return Value

True means up to date; false means out of date.

If central is locked but Revit can determine that the model in the current session is out of date without opening central, this method will return false instead of throwing CentralModelContentionException.
