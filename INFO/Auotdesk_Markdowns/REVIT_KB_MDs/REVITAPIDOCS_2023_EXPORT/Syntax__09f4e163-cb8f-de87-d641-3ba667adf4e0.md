#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document containing the elements and worksets.

generalCategories
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB RelinquishOptions](af30374c-7e99-d52e-f648-c5969e91e9d8.htm)    
     General categories of items to relinquish. See RelinquishOptions for details.

options
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB TransactWithCentralOptions](f5da22fa-55ee-9196-cafd-5323d8e9ca0a.htm)    
     Options to customize access to the central model.    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  is allowed and means no customization.

#### Return Value

The elements and worksets that were relinquished.

# Remarks

Elements and worksets owned by other users are ignored.

Only unmodified elements already in central will be relinquished by this method. Newly added and modified elements cannot be relinquished until they have been synchronized with central.

For best performance, relinquish items in one big call, rather than many small calls.
