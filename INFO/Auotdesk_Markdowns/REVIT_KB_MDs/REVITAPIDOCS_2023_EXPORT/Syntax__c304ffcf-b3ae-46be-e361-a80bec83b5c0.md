# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class ServerPath : ModelPath ``` |

# Remarks

ServerPaths must refer to Revit models.

ServerPaths are relative to the central server location, and are of the form "RSN://{HostNodeName}/{model\_path}".

The {model\_path} portion is a relative path to a Revit model. For example, the following are valid server paths:

* RSN://EXS/hospital.rvt
* RSN://EXS.autodesk.com/Old Files/hotel2.rvt
* RSN://EXS.autodesk.com/Old Files/Last Week/Tuesday\hotel2.rvt

The following would not be valid server paths:

* //EXS/Old Files/.rvt
* EXS/hospital
