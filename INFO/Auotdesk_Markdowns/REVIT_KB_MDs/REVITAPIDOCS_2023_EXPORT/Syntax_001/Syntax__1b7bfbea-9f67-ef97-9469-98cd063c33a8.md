Determines if this edge's topological direction on the Face is opposite to its parametric direction.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 21.0.0.0 (21.1.1.109)   
  **Since:**  2021

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool IsFlippedOnFace( 	Face face ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function IsFlippedOnFace ( _ 	face As Face _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool IsFlippedOnFace( 	Face^ face ) ``` |

#### Parameters

face
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Face](e32b3b1f-66fc-57cb-6e1c-aa81d1bf3e63.htm)    
     The face with respect to which the direction is considered. Must belong to the edge.

#### Return Value

true if this edge's topological direction on the Face is opposite to its parametric direction, false if the topological direction agrees with the parametric direction.

# Remarks

Outer edge loops on a Face are oriented counter-clockwise with respect to the Face's orientation, and inner loops are oriented clockwise. The topological direction of an edge on a face means the direction in which the edge's loop is being traversed.

| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | Thrown when the specified face is    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  . |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | Thrown when the specified face is not one of the faces for this edge. |
