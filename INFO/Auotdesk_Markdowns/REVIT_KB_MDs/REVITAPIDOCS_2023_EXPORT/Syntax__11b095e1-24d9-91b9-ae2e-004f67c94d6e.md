# Members

| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Uninitialized | Revit has not tried to load the link, possibly because it is a nested link and its parent failed to load. |
| LinkLoaded | The linked model loaded correctly. |
| LinkNotFound | The linked model could not be found. |
| LinkNotOpenable | An error occurred trying to read the linked model. It could happen if a wrong link type is trying to be loaded. |
| LinkOpenAsHost | The linked model is already opened directly in Revit. |
| SameModelAsHost | The linked model has the same path as the currently active document. |
| SameCentralModelAsHost | Either the linked model and its host document are both locals of the same central model, or one is a local and the other is its central. |
| LinkNotLoadedOtherError | An unknown error occurred. |
| LinkMayBeUpgraded | Point cloud link loaded correctly but is obsolete and may be upgraded. |
| ExternalServerMissing | The external add-in required to load this link model could not be found. |
| LinkExists | Revit already has a link with the input location, so no new link can be created. |
| CouldNotChangeViewReference | The link previously had an invalid view reference and either no new view was provided or the input view was not usable for linking CAD files. |
| UsedExisting | Revit already has a link with the input location, so the same link is been reused. |

# Remarks

For all values except LinkLoadResultType.LinkLoaded, the linked model is not loaded and no new link is created (if Revit was trying to create a link).
