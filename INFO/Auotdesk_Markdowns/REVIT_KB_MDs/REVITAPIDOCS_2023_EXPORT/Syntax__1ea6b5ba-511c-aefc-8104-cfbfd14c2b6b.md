# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double Distance { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property Distance As Double 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property double Distance { 	double get (); 	void set (double value); } ``` |

# Remarks

This does not take into account points obtained by intersections with other elements. When the layout is set to 'None' the distance is the value that would be used by the 'FixedDistance' layout.
