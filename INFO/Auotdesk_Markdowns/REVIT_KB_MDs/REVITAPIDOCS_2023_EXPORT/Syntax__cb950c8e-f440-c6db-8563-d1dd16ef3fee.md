#### Parameters

targetDocument
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The target document which the family will be loaded into.

familyLoadOptions
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB IFamilyLoadOptions](d447ed92-74e1-2125-dd0a-38a5ae85ce53.htm)    
     The interface implementation to use when responding to conflicts during the load operation.

#### Return Value

Reference of the family in the target document.

# Remarks

If you are reloading an edited family back into the source document from which it was extracted, use this overload. This is because this overload allows you to respond to possible conflicts due to families already being present in the target document. The Revit API offers one automatic overload: RevitUIFamilyLoadOptions, which will show the same prompts to the user as seen during an interactive load.

# Exceptions
