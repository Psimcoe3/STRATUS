The  [DirectShapeLibrary](07489bae-ab9f-e2a8-0ac1-0a4d70cea458.htm)  type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [AddDefinition(String, GeometryObject)](bd9edd01-aa2d-10d3-1d78-fb8883da3134.htm) | Add a definition to be reused by instances. A definition is a single geometry object. |
| Public method | [AddDefinition(String, IList GeometryObject )](08cb25e6-8a3f-ba50-486d-272d6d29add9.htm) | Add a definition to be reused by instances. A definition is a collection of geometry objects. |
| Public method | [AddDefinitionType](2cdbc926-c1f1-d6f3-f37d-e75d1a0e0e1b.htm) | Add a definition to be reused by instances. Adding a definition type will change how the instances are created. When asked to create a definition, the library object will look for a corresponding type object. If one is found, it will create an instance of geometry stored in the type object. If it is not found, the library will look for a list of geometry objects stored as definition, and will copy and transform these to create an instance. |
| Public method | [Contains](dc950462-3260-64e6-a04f-eb3c2e0266d7.htm) | A quick check whether a definition already exists in the library. Checks for stored geometry objects only. |
| Public method | [ContainsType](ebad7e8c-6037-401e-fa65-9957e5904a7b.htm) | A quick check whether a definition type already exists in the library. Checks for type objects only. |
| Public method | [Dispose](fb175e54-120e-39c0-3a9f-ddf74f7f14fc.htm) | Releases all resources used by the  [DirectShapeLibrary](07489bae-ab9f-e2a8-0ac1-0a4d70cea458.htm) |
| Public method | [Equals](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bsc2ak47) | Determines whether the specified  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  is equal to the current  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  . (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
| Public method | [FindDefinition](197f93e0-7577-8f1c-c039-81e4ae989a4f.htm) | Find a definition by id |
| Public method | [FindDefinitionType](c1a53b64-8ceb-e144-3f68-561c6f62a165.htm) | Find a DirectShapeType element by definition id. The element will be used for creating instances of that definition. |
| Public method Static member | [GetDirectShapeLibrary](a9b9ac8d-1a11-c5b3-f073-bb52eb6212d9.htm) | Get the currently active Library object |
| Public method | [GetHashCode](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zdee4b3y) | Serves as a hash function for a particular type. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
| Public method | [GetType](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dfwy45w9) | Gets the  [Type](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/42892f65)  of the current instance. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
| Public method | [Reset](05734cf8-b84d-63de-47f2-9abc8f226fc7.htm) | Removes all definitions from library. This is useful when importing several self-contained data sets within one session. Once a data set is imported, keeping the definitions specific to that data set will slow down the searches. |
| Public method | [ToString](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7bxwbwt2) | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public property | [IsValidObject](8fd1e459-6ca9-eb04-b9a5-c6dcf6478c45.htm) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
