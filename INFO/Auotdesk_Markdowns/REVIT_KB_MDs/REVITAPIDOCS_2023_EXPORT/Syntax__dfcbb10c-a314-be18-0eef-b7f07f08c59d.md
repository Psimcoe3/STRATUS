The Id of the symbol associated with the node. This property is deprecated in Revit 2023 and may be removed in a future version of Revit. For an InstanceNode please use the GetSymbolGeometryId().SymbolId. For a LinkNode please use SymbolId property. In Revit 2023 we introduced instance nodes that point to a part of the symbol's geometry. For comparing if two such nodes point to the same geometry, the SymbolId isn't enough. SymbolGeometryId can be used to identify a piece of geometry managed by a symbol element.
