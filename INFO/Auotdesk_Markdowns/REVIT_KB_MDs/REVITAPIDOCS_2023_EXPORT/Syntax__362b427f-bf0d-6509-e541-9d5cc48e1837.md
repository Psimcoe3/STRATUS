Retrieves all of the phases in the document.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public PhaseArray Phases { get; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public ReadOnly Property Phases As PhaseArray 	Get ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property PhaseArray^ Phases { 	PhaseArray^ get (); } ``` |

# Remarks

The phases are returned in order from earliest phase to latest phase.

When Revit is running with UI activated, the default created phase for newly created elements is inherited from the phase of the currently active view.

When Revit is running without its UI, such as when Revit runs on Autodesk Forge Design Automation API for Revit, the default phase for newly created elements is the latest phase in the document.
