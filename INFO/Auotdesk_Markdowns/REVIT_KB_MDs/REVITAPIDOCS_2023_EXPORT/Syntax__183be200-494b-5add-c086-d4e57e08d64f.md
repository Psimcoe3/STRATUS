# Remarks

For a FabricSheet or FabricArea element, this could be FabricArea, FabricSheetType, or ReinforcementSettings. For a FabricSheetType, this could be FabricSheetType or ReinforcementSettings. All FabricSheets hosted by common FabricArea must have common reinforcement rounding overrides so at instance level its overrides are in FabricArea, not in FabricSheets.
