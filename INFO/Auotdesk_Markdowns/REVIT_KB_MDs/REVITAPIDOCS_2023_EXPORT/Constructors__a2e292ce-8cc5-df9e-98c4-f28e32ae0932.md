| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [AddFace](401c4066-4ec1-be8c-53ae-daea44f3244d.htm) | Adds a face to the currently open connected face set. |
| Public method | [AreTargetAndFallbackCompatible](fc565805-bda1-2cd3-6bf0-e0defa4edfc9.htm) | Checks whether this combination of fallback and target parameters can be used as a valid combination of inputs. |

| Public method | [CancelConnectedFaceSet](11a71aab-1685-27ad-10c4-328e4a02b4fb.htm) | Cancels the current face set - i.e., all data from it will be lost and the builder will have no open connected face set anymore. |
| Public method | [Clear](8c2cd942-f8c3-3288-bac6-8d4d1f064714.htm) | Erases all face set and clears the logs, if any. |
| Public method | [CloseConnectedFaceSet](0bebb71c-317e-3dbc-1304-169561e22214.htm) | Closes the currently open connected face set. |
| Public method Static member | [CreateMeshByExtrusion](16bfff9e-b581-94b8-4797-cb880d79e793.htm) | Builds a mesh by extruding curve loop(s) along extrusion distance. |

| Public method | [DoesFaceHaveEnoughLoopsAndVertices](894594d4-e75a-843e-ed5f-c9554feec2f4.htm) | Checks whether 'face' has enough loops and vertcies to be valid. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Public property | [Fallback](59acf1d0-742a-45eb-df1c-edbb136279a4.htm) | Defines acceptable fallback if the desired type of geometry can't be built. |
