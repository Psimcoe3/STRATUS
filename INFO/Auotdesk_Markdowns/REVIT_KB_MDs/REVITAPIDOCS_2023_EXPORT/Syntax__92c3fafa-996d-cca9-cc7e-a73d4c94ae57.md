# Syntax

| ``` public enum RebarShapeSegmentEndReferenceType ``` |

# Members

| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Straight | Refers to the end of the straight part of the segment: the point where the bend begins. |
| Exterior | Refers to the farthest point on the arc of the bend. Assuming the bend is 90 degrees or more, an Exterior constraint will be longer than a Straight constraint by an amount equal to the bend radius. |

# Remarks

The RebarShapeSegmentEndReferenceType of a constraint is meaningful only when the bend is  [right](176a9649-853e-f173-c108-d6722fcd5b61.htm)  or  [obtuse](176a9649-853e-f173-c108-d6722fcd5b61.htm)  . If the bend is  [acute](176a9649-853e-f173-c108-d6722fcd5b61.htm)  , the reference type is ignored.
