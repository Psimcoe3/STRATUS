# Remarks

The type of surface is figured out depending on the source element and the number of space adjacencies.

* If there is no associate source element and no space adjacencies, it will have a type of Shade. If there are any space adjacencies, it will have a type of Air.
* If the source element is a Wall or a Curtain Wall and have one space adjacency, it will have a type of ExteriorWall.
* If the source element is a Wall or a Curtain Wall and have two space adjacencies, it will have a type of InteriorWall.
* If the source element is a Wall or a Curtain Wall and the type Function parameter is set to "Interior" or "CoreShaft", it will have a type of InteriorWall.
* If the source element is a Wall or a Curtain Wall and have one space adjacency and if it is below grade, it will have a type of UndergroundWall.
* If the source element is a Floor and have one space adjacency, it will have a type of SlabOnGrade. If the source element is above grade, it will have a type of RaisedFloor. If the source element is below grade, it will have a type of UndergroundSlab.
* If the source element is a Floor and have two space adjacencies, it will have a type of InteriorFloor.
* If the source element is a Floor and the type Function parameter is set to "Interior", it will have a type of InteriorFloor.
* If the source element is a Roof or a Ceiling and have one space adjacency, it will have a type of Roof.
* If the source element is a Roof or a Ceiling and have one space adjacency and is below grade, it will have a type of UndergroundCeiling.
