# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method Static member | [Create](8c296707-eb09-33b6-cad8-05e1894b34f2.htm) | Construct BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry based on a permitted Revit Surface, including Plane and CylSurf. |
| Public method Static member | [CreateNURBSSurface(Int32, Int32, IList Double , IList Double , IList XYZ , Boolean, BoundingBoxUV)](96a6a3b6-4e18-f94c-587e-4a8345784065.htm) | Construct a BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry based on NURBS surface data, where the weights are not supplied. In this case, the NURBS surface will be a piecewise polynomial surface. |
| Public method Static member | [CreateNURBSSurface(Int32, Int32, IList Double , IList Double , IList XYZ , IList Double , Boolean, BoundingBoxUV)](04ce47fc-117b-8e48-c388-7f2de2bbaa96.htm) | Construct BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry based on NURBS surface data, where the weights are supplied. In this case, the NURBS surface will be a piecewise rational polynomial surface. |
| Public method | [Dispose](39ac06f7-f595-ff9a-314d-c578b0208a9f.htm) | Releases all resources used by the  [BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry](c21d4101-cc15-1990-ee9f-994b487bf95d.htm) |
| Public method | [Equals](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bsc2ak47) | Determines whether the specified  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  is equal to the current  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  . (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
| Public method | [GetHashCode](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zdee4b3y) | Serves as a hash function for a particular type. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
