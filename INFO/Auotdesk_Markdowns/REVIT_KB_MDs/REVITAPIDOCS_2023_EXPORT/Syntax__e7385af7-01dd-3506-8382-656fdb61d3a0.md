The family [Family Name] was containing one or more invalid cuts, which have been removed (most likely it was cutting a curtain wall). Please examine the family and make changes as needed.\r\nHint 1: If you are trying to cut a Curtain Wall, you may be able to achieve the desired result by editing the Elevation Profile or the curtain panel.\r\n Hint 2: If you can't see the family, you can still select it from the Project Browser.\r\nHint 3: This warning will disappear after you edit and then finish the family.
