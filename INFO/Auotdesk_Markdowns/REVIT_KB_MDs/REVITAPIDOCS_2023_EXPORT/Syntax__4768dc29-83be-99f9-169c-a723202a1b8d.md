Restores the workshared load status of a link that has been unloaded only for the current user, in a local copy of a workshared model.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2016 Subscription Update

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public LinkedFileStatus RevertLocalUnloadStatus() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function RevertLocalUnloadStatus As LinkedFileStatus ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: LinkedFileStatus RevertLocalUnloadStatus() ``` |

#### Return Value

The link's LinkedFileStatus that has resulted from reverting the local unloaded status.

# Remarks

This function removes the local user's override of the link's workshared load status (see UnloadLocally method). That is, if the link is loaded in the central model for all worksharing users (and thus has been only unloaded for the local user), then this method will perform a full reload of the link for the local user. If the link is unloaded in the central model, then this method will simply clear the local user's unload override, so that the link will be reloaded in the local user's model, if it is ever reloaded in the central model.

This function should not be called on a Revit link:

* in a document which is in an edit mode or is in family mode.
* in a document which is in dynamic update.
* in a document which is read only.
* in a document in which there is transaction phase left open.
* in a non-workshared file.
* in a central model of workshared file.
* which is nested.
* which are not locally unloaded.

If the link is an external resource, Revit will contact the IExternalResourceServer to get the latest version of the link.
