#### Return Value

# Remarks

The workset can't be deleted in the following cases:

* The input worksetId is not valid in the document.
* The input worksetId doesn't represent a user-created workset, which means this workset might be a system workset.
* The workset is not editable by the current user. In order to resolve this problem, please checkout the workset by calling  [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::WorksharingUtils::CheckoutWorksets]  .
* The workset or some elements under the workset are owned by the other users. In order to resolve this problem, please ask the other users to call  [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::WorksharingUtils::RelinquishOwnership]  to relinquish their ownership on the workset and elements.
* The target workset is not a user-created workset.
