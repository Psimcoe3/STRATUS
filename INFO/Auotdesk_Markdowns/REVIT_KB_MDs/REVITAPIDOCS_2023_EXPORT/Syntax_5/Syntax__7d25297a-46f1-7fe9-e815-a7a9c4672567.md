Move and resize the bar to fit within a specified box. The arguments are interpreted as an arbitrary rectangle in 3D with vertices: origin, origin+xVec, origin+xVec+yVec, origin+yVec. The algorithm then proceeds as follows. First the bar is given the default values of the shape parameters from the shape definition. Then, if it is possible to do so without violating the shape definition, the parameter values are scaled so that the width and height of the shape (including bar thickness) match the lengths of xVec and yVec. If there is no way to do this within the shape definition due to overconstraining, a compromise is attempted, such as scaling the whole shape until either the width or the height is correct. Finally the shape is rotated to match the coordinate system of the box. The algorithm is the same one used in one-click placement.

#### Parameters

origin
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     One corner of the rectangle.

xVec
