  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |

Try again. -or- Some of the elements you changed in this model are now editable by someone else, or you checked out worksets that were at risk or relinquished in the central model but not this file. You cannot synchronize with the central model until the other user relinquishes these elements without making changes. -or- The central model has been replaced by a local model. -or- Local incompatible because it was closed without saving after synchronizing with central. -or- The central model is missing. -or- The central model is incompatible. -or- The central model is corrupt or not an RVT file. -or- The central model was rolled back. -or- The central model's elements have been relinquished -or- Your data or permissions saving is aborted by another user. -or- The central model is overritten by other user. -or- An internal error happened on the central model, please contact the server administrator. |

It can not be saved before or after synchronizing with central. -or- This Document is not a workshared document. -or- Saving local before first reload latest and after saving changes to central in Synchronize with Central is mandatory for server-based local models. -or- Operation is not permitted when there is any open sub-transaction, transaction, or transaction group. |
