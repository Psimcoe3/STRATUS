| [Transaction Class](308ebf8d-d96d-4643-cd1d-34fffcea53fd.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Starts the transaction with an assigned name.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public TransactionStatus Start( 	string name ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Start ( _ 	name As String _ ) As TransactionStatus ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: TransactionStatus Start( 	String^ name ) ``` |

#### Parameters

name
:   Type:  System String    
     Name of the transaction; If the transaction already has name, this new one will preplace it. The name will appear on the Undo menu in Revit if the transaction is successfully committed.

#### Return Value

If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Started. Note that unless starting is successful, changes cannot be made to the document.

# Remarks

A transaction may be started only after it was instantiated or after it was previously committed or rolled back.

Be aware that every time a transaction starts,  [Failure Handling Options](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.htm)  will be reset to their default values. If a specific failure handling is required, programmers need to use  [SetFailureHandlingOptions(FailureHandlingOptions)](1e913cca-f75b-8dfb-b172-5a04f3732b85.htm)  before the transaction is committed or rolled back.

    // All and any transaction should be enclosed in a 'using'
    // block or guarded within a try-catch-finally blocks
    // to guarantee that a transaction does not out-live its scope.
    using (Transaction transaction = new Transaction(document))
    {
       transaction.Start("Transaction name");

       // some modification of the document here, likely resulting in 
       // changes of the 'result' value
       // ..... 

       if (result == true)
       {
          // Modifications ended successfully, but it is still possible
          // for the transaction to fail due to model regeneration
          // (and other internal processes that validate the model)
          if (TransactionStatus.Committed != transaction.Commit())
          {
             result = false;
          }
       }
       else  // if modifications failed, transaction is to be rolled back
       {
          transaction.RollBack();
       }

| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | Cannot modify the document for either a read-only external command is being executed, or changes to the document are temporarily disabled. -or- The transaction's document is currently in failure mode. No transaction operations are permitted until failure handling is finished. -or- The transaction started already and has not been completed yet. -or- Starting a new transaction is not permitted. It could be because another transaction already started and has not been completed yet, or the document is in a state in which it cannot start a new transaction (e.g. during failure handling or a read-only mode, which could be either permanent or temporary). |
