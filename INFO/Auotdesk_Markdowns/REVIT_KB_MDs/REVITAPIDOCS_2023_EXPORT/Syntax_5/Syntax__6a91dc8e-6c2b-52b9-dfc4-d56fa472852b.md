# Syntax

#### Parameters

targetDocument
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The target document where the family will be loaded.

#### Return Value

Reference of the family in the target document.

# Remarks

If you are reloading an edited family back into the source document from which it was extracted, this method will always fail. This is because this method automatically suppresses the prompts Revit typically uses to deal with conflicts between families, and assumes that any such conflict should prevent the loading. If you want to be able to reload the same family into the source document, you should use the LoadFamily() overload accepting  [IFamilyLoadOptions](d447ed92-74e1-2125-dd0a-38a5ae85ce53.htm)  .
