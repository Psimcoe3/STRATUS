# Remarks

This event is raised when Revit is just about to export a view of the document. It is raised only during accelerated export jobs, in which views are exported in parallel using a background process. Accelerated export only occurs when exporting to DWF formats and not combining views into a single file.

Handlers of this event are permitted to make modifications to any document (including the active document), except for documents that are currently in read-only mode.

Event is not cancellable. The 'Cancellable' property of event's argument is always False.

The following API functions are not available for the current document during this event:

* All overloads of Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document.Export()
* Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document.Print()
* [Print](1ea1e825-8044-7a27-d9b9-ca463443c3b9.htm)  and similar overloads.
* [SubmitPrint](0c9524b7-33b5-8c76-2843-c7024f03e4d7.htm)  and similar overloads.

* [SaveAs(String)](25c44d4a-b220-5898-b28c-a2cf6a8a8673.htm)  and similar overloads.

Exception  [InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm)  will be thrown if any of the above methods is called during this event.

Another event  [ViewExported](0a3d3bee-957a-45e0-3779-b1b924a0ce0f.htm)  will be raised immediately after view exporting is finished.
