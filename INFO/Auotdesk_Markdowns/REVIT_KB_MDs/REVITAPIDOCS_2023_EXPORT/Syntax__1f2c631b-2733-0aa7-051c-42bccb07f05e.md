# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void ExtractPartAtomFromFamilyFile( 	string familyFilePath, 	string xmlFilePath ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub ExtractPartAtomFromFamilyFile ( _ 	familyFilePath As String, _ 	xmlFilePath As String _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

#### Parameters

familyFilePath
:   Type:  [System String](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1wwdcbf)    
     The family file to be processed.

xmlFilePath
:   Type:  [System String](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1wwdcbf)    
     The xml file to be saved.

# Remarks

If there is a TXT type catalog next to the family file (a TXT file with the same name as the RFA file), the function will read it as well and process its contents into PartAtom. To extract a PartAtom XML from a family loaded into a document in session, use Family.ExtractPartAtom().
