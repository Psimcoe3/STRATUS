# Remarks

This property supersedes the older  [!:LineWidth]  property which has been deprecated.

The value is in sheet units, meaning it is as when measured on a printed sheet. The measurement is of the text content only; the border around it (if specified) is excluded.

For a text element which does is set not to use text wrapping the width is calculated to fit the longest line (a single line, typically) of the text. A setting the width explicitly by assigning value to this property will automatically activate text-wrapping for the element.
