| [CurveElement Class](61673852-2d08-003d-e9fd-4be89d533774.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public virtual SketchPlane SketchPlane { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Overridable Property SketchPlane As SketchPlane 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: virtual property SketchPlane^ SketchPlane { 	SketchPlane^ get (); 	void set (SketchPlane^ value); } ``` |

# Remarks

The new sketch plane must be parallel to the existing sketch plane. Setting this property is not permitted for detail curves because they must be placed only on view-specific planes.

# Exceptions
