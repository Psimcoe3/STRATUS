The  [GroupNode](8b1cabde-3c37-1735-a186-2ce026555ce0.htm)  type exposes the following members.

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [Dispose](8ee082fe-ab92-67e6-f2bd-b285d419a005.htm) | (Inherited from  [RenderNode](9900b69b-7cb7-8555-75ac-4b5f22b5fa7f.htm)  .) |
| Public method | Equals | Determines whether the specified  Object  is equal to the current  Object  . (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | [GetSymbolId](dfcbb10c-a314-be18-0eef-b7f07f08c59d.htm) | **Obsolete.**   The Id of the symbol associated with the node. This property is deprecated in Revit 2023 and may be removed in a future version of Revit. For an InstanceNode please use the GetSymbolGeometryId().SymbolId. For a LinkNode please use SymbolId property. In Revit 2023 we introduced instance nodes that point to a part of the symbol's geometry. For comparing if two such nodes point to the same geometry, the SymbolId isn't enough. SymbolGeometryId can be used to identify a piece of geometry managed by a symbol element. |
| Public method | [GetTransform](13e9ba28-e94a-c79f-689c-4367883d62bd.htm) | A transformation matrix associated with the node. |
| Public method | GetType | Gets the  Type  of the current instance. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
