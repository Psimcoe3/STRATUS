| Public method | [OnInstanceBegin](2db35bdb-8d14-a015-9bfb-9283f503edab.htm) | This method marks the start of processing of an instance node (e.g. a family instance). (Inherited from  [IExportContext](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.htm)  .) |
| Public method | [OnInstanceEnd](d1340660-fcc9-3bfd-58fb-8d114aa39517.htm) | This method marks the end of processing of an Instance Node (e.g. a family instance). (Inherited from  [IExportContext](7d0dc6df-db0e-6a07-3b42-8dde1bedb3c1.htm)  .) |
