| Public method | [Evaluate](ea7d15ea-e248-e217-2900-662be2e4d274.htm) | Evaluates and returns the point at the specified parameter along the curve. |
| Public method | [GetEndParameter](daa1ae74-36c8-fcfb-48d9-d9040df6d54f.htm) | Gets the raw parameter value at the start or end of this curve. |
| Public method | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | GetType | Gets the  Type  of the current instance. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | [Transform](628d9276-4912-58c8-8601-5f6b5266158c.htm) | Transform this CurveUV by the given 2D affine transform if possible. |
