The CurveElements must be CurveByPoints. Each curve must be entirely hosted by a single Face or hosts related to a common Face (for example, Edges of a common Face, other CurveElements hosted by a common Face). To be added to the FaceRegion definition, a CurveElement must have the SketchOnSurface attribute set. |
