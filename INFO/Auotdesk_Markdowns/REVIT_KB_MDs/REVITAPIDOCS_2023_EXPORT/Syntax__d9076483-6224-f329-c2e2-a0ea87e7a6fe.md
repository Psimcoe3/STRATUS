# Remarks

There are three valid values for this integer: 0 = export no space boundaries. This can save space if the receiving application doesn't use them. 1 = export 1st level space boundaries. This is the default. 2 = export 2nd level space boundaries. This is primarily for use in energy analysis programs, and the GSA. Default is 1.
