| [ViewCropRegionShapeManager Class](2610cb66-5dae-9fc8-4e83-7dfe88085abb.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Sets the boundary of the view's crop to the specified shape.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void SetCropShape( 	CurveLoop boundary ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub SetCropShape ( _ 	boundary As CurveLoop _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void SetCropShape( 	CurveLoop^ boundary ) ``` |

#### Parameters

boundary
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)    
     The crop boundary.

# Remarks

Depending on the shape of the argument, view's crop is set to be either rectangular or non-rectangular. If the crop is set to be rectangular and it is also split, then the multiple view regions will be displayed for the view, with the same proportions as the split prior to the change, but adjusted to the new rectangular shape.

This Method is reserved for setting crop shape in views that allow non-rectangular crop shapes - see property  [CanHaveShape](4ed96171-c8ac-1623-f1d3-5da38d1bd834.htm)  . For views that don't allow non-rectangular crop shapes (e.g.  [View3D](d795a238-fc24-1875-e64f-a2bef56ae949.htm)  ), please use property  [CropBox](d6246051-ecfb-7388-0429-6ed65de72638.htm)  for that purpose.
