#### Parameters

view
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.htm)    
     An instance of the view to export

# Remarks

Note that the actual export process may differ depending on the type of export context used. For example, when the  [IModelExportContext](4309af43-f04e-4e42-2539-3fd1d64cdc6d.htm)  is used, Revit is likely to perform several rounds of traversing each view, which may result in invoking the OnViewBegin/OnViewEnd method multiple times for every one view. It is because Revit draws objects in several layers (model layer, annotation layer, etc.) and will traverse each layer individually. In the most common scenario the user will receive two invocations of OnViewBegin/OnViewEnd: In the first round, all model entities will be received, while in the second round all text annotation elements will be received, if any present in the given view.
