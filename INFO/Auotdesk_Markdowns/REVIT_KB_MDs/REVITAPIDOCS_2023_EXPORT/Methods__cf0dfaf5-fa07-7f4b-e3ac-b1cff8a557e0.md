| Public method | [GetDeletedElementIds](d19575f3-a6cb-c532-78a2-2b513378af4a.htm) | Returns set of elements that were deleted from the document. This set is mutually exclusive of elements returned by getAddedElementIds() and getModifiedElementIds(). |
| Public method | [GetDocument](cb58fbb1-e923-b2f3-8b74-9aac45ad2d0f.htm) | Returns document associated with this UpdaterData |
| Public method | [GetHashCode](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zdee4b3y) | Serves as a hash function for a particular type. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |

| Public method | [IsChangeTriggered](c5dcda11-ce70-52d3-f415-60dc4c2d88a2.htm) | Allows updater to check if specific change has happened to an element. Compares input type to the types that caused Updater::execute() to be triggered. If input type was not registered as a trigger for the associated Updater, this method will always return false for that ChangeType. For example, if the only trigger registered for UpdaterX is ChangeTypeAny for Element A, then passing in ChangeTypeGeometry will return false even if the geometry of A changed because the registered trigger was ChangeTypeAny. However, passing in ChangeTypeAny will return true. |
