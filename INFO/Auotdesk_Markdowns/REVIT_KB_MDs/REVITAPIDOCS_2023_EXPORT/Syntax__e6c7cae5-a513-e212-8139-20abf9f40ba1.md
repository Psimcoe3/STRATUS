#### Parameters

view
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.htm)    
     The view that the attached detail groups must be compatible with.

# Remarks

Currently, perpendicular elevation views (for example, North and East views) are considered compatible when deciding whether or not to allow a detail group to be displayed in a view. The show operation may generate an error (FailureMessage) based on id if the orientation of the annotations do not match the orientation of the target view (for example, the failure definition DimensionPerpendicularToView). To prevent displaying detail groups in the wrong view, you can check the OwnerViewId of a detail group to make sure it matches the view in which you are trying to display it.
