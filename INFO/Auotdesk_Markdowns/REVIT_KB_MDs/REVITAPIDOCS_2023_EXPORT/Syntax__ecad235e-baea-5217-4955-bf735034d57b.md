# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` RenderNodeAction OnFaceSilhouette2D( 	FaceSilhouetteNode node ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Function OnFaceSilhouette2D ( _ 	node As FaceSilhouetteNode _ ) As RenderNodeAction ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` RenderNodeAction OnFaceSilhouette2D( 	FaceSilhouetteNode^ node ) ``` |

#### Parameters

node
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FaceSilhouetteNode](7f6dab2d-6285-1027-9b4a-39d773002442.htm)    
     An output node that represents a Face silhouette.

#### Return Value

Return RenderNodeAction.Proceed if you wish to receive tessellated geometry (line or polyline segments) for this face silhouette, or otherwise return RenderNodeAction.Skip.

Note: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style tesselated geometry will be output regardless of the return value.

# Remarks

Note that this method is invoked only if the custom exporter was set up to include geometric objects in the output stream. See  [IncludeGeometricObjects](2ce1075e-380e-01e7-6459-b7467c2a2414.htm)  for mode details.

Note: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style this method will be called regardless of whether the object will be eventially output, i.e. even if it's occluded by another element.
