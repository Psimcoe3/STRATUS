Add a constraint that helps determine the length of a segment.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure](d586b341-f687-9d90-e96d-255806b7d4fc.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void AddConstraintToSegment( 	int iSegment, 	ElementId paramId, 	double constraintDirCoordX, 	double constraintDirCoordY, 	int signOfZCoordOfCrossProductOfConstraintDirBySegmentDir, 	bool measureToOutsideOfBend0, 	bool measureToOutsideOfBend1 ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub AddConstraintToSegment ( _ 	iSegment As Integer, _ 	paramId As ElementId, _ 	constraintDirCoordX As Double, _ 	constraintDirCoordY As Double, _ 	signOfZCoordOfCrossProductOfConstraintDirBySegmentDir As Integer, _ 	measureToOutsideOfBend0 As Boolean, _ 	measureToOutsideOfBend1 As Boolean _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void AddConstraintToSegment( 	int iSegment,  	ElementId^ paramId,  	double constraintDirCoordX,  	double constraintDirCoordY,  	int signOfZCoordOfCrossProductOfConstraintDirBySegmentDir,  	bool measureToOutsideOfBend0,  	bool measureToOutsideOfBend1 ) ``` |

#### Parameters

iSegment
:   Type:  System Int32    
     Index of the segment (0 to NumberOfSegments - 1).

paramId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     Id of a parameter to drive the constraint. To obtain the id of a shared parameter, call RebarShape.GetElementIdForExternalDefinition().

constraintDirCoordX
:   Type:  System Double    
     The x-coordinate of a 2D vector specifying the constraint direction.

constraintDirCoordY
:   Type:  System Double    
     The y-coordinate of a 2D vector specifying the constraint direction.

signOfZCoordOfCrossProductOfConstraintDirBySegmentDir
:   Type:  System Int32    
     Legal values are 1 and -1. For a fixed-direction segment, this value is ignored. For a variable-direction segment, this value is combined with the constraint length (the nonnegative value associated with 'param') to determine the direction of the segment. For example, a segment whose direction vector lies in the upper-right quadrant of the plane, and whose x-axis projected length is A and whose y-axis projected length is B, could be created by calling: AddConstraintToSegment(iSegment, paramA, 1.0, 0.0, 1, ...) AddConstraintToSegment(iSegment, paramB, 0.0, 1.0, -1, ...)

measureToOutsideOfBend0
:   Type:  System Boolean    
     Choose between two possibilities for the first reference of the length dimension. If false, the reference is at the point where the bend begins; equivalently, at the projection of the bend centerpoint onto the segment. If true, the reference is moved outward by a distance equal to the bend radius plus the bar diameter; if the bend is a right angle or greater, this is equivalent to putting the reference at the outer face of the bend.

measureToOutsideOfBend1
:   Type:  System Boolean    
     Choose between two possibilities for the second reference of the length dimension.

# Remarks

The vector defined by (constraintDirCoordX, constraintDirCoordY) must have a positive dot product with the desired direction of the segment. This restriction, combined with the value of signOfZCoordOfCrossProductOfConstraintDirBySegmentDir, defines a quadrant of the plane that limits the variable-angle segment.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | iSegment is not between 0 and NumberOfSegments. -or- paramId is not the id of a shared parameter in the current document, or its unit type is not UT\_Reinforcement\_Length or UT\_Angle. -or- The length of the vector (constraintDirCoordX, constraintDirCoordY) is too close to zero. -or- signOfZCoordOfCrossProductOfConstraintDirBySegmentDir is neither -1 nor 1. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
