# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [OnCurve](6306ac1d-c259-5617-f71b-c13e54e5af0d.htm) | This method is called when a Curve is being output. (Inherited from  [IExportContextBase](6691ecd5-a88a-1f58-7a71-a8f6233b6c51.htm)  .) |
| Public method | [OnLineSegment](5fe0cee4-825b-9828-2c45-5e4c5019bc37.htm) | This method is called after unhandled curve was tessellated to line segments and sent to the output. Note for 2D export: if the export is performed for the view in non-Wireframe display style, then   * this method is called outside of view, instance and link begin/end calls but still between OnElementBegin2D/OnElementEnd2D calls * this method is never called for annotation elements, i.e. their geometry should be processed in methods OnCurve and OnPolyline (Inherited from  [IExportContextBase](6691ecd5-a88a-1f58-7a71-a8f6233b6c51.htm)  .) |
| Public method | [OnPoint](6d0a592f-9961-e0ff-70a3-b67bb815e0d4.htm) | This method is called when a Point is being output. |
| Public method | [OnPolyline](12a8d0af-f3e2-e5f3-aa19-797adebaff2b.htm) | This method is called when a Polyline is being output. (Inherited from  [IExportContextBase](6691ecd5-a88a-1f58-7a71-a8f6233b6c51.htm)  .) |
| Public method | [OnPolylineSegments](c3891505-dd89-50d4-519e-5380af669325.htm) | This method is called after unhandled curve was tessellated to polyline segments and sent to the output.
