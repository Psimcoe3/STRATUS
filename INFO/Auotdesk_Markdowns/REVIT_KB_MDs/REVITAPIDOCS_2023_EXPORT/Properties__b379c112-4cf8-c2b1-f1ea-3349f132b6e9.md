| Public property Static member | [DividedSurfaceSingleCurveMultipleIntersBetweenOppositeVirtualGrids](c378ea43-dc1d-a2e6-cc09-927d42b6d8cb.htm) | There are curves in splitting chain of virtual splitters defined by these elements which intersect each other multiple times and so one of the virtual splitters will be ignored |
| Public property Static member | [DividedSurfaceSplitManagerProblem1dNonWPCurve](fa1113f5-8ae4-d627-5058-4a7ff6582594.htm) | Divided Surface cannot be split by a one dimensional curve without workplane |
| Public property Static member | [DividedSurfaceSplitManagerProblemClosedArcOrEllipse](903174dc-a936-f665-980c-b8bcca410ae5.htm) | Divided Surface cannot be split by a closed arc or ellipse. |
| Public property Static member | [DividedSurfaceSplitRefInvisible](8a2eab49-c89b-e685-5846-2f4b860b1c55.htm) | Some of the splitting references of this Divided Surface are invisible in the current view. |

| Public property Static member | [DividedSurfaceSplittingCurvesWithMultipleNeighbors](a92c8d26-83f3-3bdd-943f-6cf63f30e41a.htm) | A point cannot coincide with end points of more than two curve elements. All curve elements adjacent to such a point are ignored. |
| Public property Static member | [DividedSurfaceZeroLengthSplittingCurve](626e7993-fe15-b8ba-26c9-e1b464619fa6.htm) | Curve element with zero length cannot be used as a splitter and ignored. |
| Public property Static member | [MeshTopologicalSortFailed](a5b260de-5dfb-a79e-8d81-41fa977ab014.htm) | Splitters and grids do not define a consistent rectangular mesh on the face. |
