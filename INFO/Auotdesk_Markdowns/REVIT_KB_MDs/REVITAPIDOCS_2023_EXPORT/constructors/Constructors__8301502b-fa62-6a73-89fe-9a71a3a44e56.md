The  [BRepBuilderPersistentIds](c9dd5c21-1d35-9f12-ec28-553e699a6ee2.htm)  type exposes the following members.

# Constructors

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [BRepBuilderPersistentIds](657afa4a-9115-e65e-c69a-9571817478b5.htm) | Constructs a new BRepBuilderPersistentIds and associates the existing BRepBuilder to it. |

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [AddSubTag](c8bf3c16-6864-8323-3c57-c132e9282473.htm) | Adds a correspondence between an ExternalGeometryId and a BRepBuilderGeometryId. Note that an existing correspondence in the map cannot be updated and that a particular BRepBuilderGeometryId may be related to at most one ExternalGeometryId. |
| Public method | [Dispose](73d61523-7280-b04d-480f-9ae04a9373af.htm) | Releases all resources used by the  [BRepBuilderPersistentIds](c9dd5c21-1d35-9f12-ec28-553e699a6ee2.htm) |
| Public method | Equals | Determines whether the specified  Object  is equal to the current  Object  . (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | GetType | Gets the  Type  of the current instance. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | [IsAssociatedBRepBuilderValid](817496ab-6542-91cf-247d-6455add3df09.htm) | Validates the associated (in the constructor) BRepBuilder for this BRepBuilderPersistentIds. |
| Public method | [IsBRepBuilderGeometryIdFaceOrEdge](22fae990-9618-4ea0-3fc7-775000c40a94.htm) | Validates the input BRepBuilderGeometryId that will be used to create a correspondence. In order to be valid, the input BRepBuilderGeometryId must represent the ID of either a Face or an Edge. |
| Public method | [IsValidBRepBuilderGeometryIdForNewCorrespondence](1d7e2823-e05b-2519-a55b-1b3075744497.htm) | Validates the input BRepBuilderGeometryId that will be used to create a correspondence. In order to be valid, a correspondence for the input BRepBuilderGeometryId must not already exist. |
| Public method | [IsValidExternalGeometryIdForNewCorrespondence](634779e5-d3d2-c68c-ccc8-07731fe44486.htm) | Validates the input ExternalGeometryId that will be used to create a correspondence. In order to be valid, a correspondence for the input ExternalGeometryId must not already exist. |
| Public method | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from  Object  .) |

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public property | [IsValidObject](e0360a5c-0c10-36fe-c53f-65ec6022a5e8.htm) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. |
