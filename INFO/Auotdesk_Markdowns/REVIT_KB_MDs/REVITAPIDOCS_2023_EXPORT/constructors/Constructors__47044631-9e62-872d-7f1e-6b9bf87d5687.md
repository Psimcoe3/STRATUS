|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [VertexBuffer](c19f57b3-4b5a-3f01-61d8-91fd23da70b4.htm) | Constructs the vertex buffer with the given capacity, measured in floats. |

# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [Dispose](3b9f2298-d268-34b0-405f-754557e1ca49.htm) | Releases all resources used by the  [VertexBuffer](329e5617-ce46-a993-1131-85c64f0842f2.htm) |
| Public method | [Equals](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bsc2ak47) | Determines whether the specified  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  is equal to the current  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  . (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |

| Public method | [GetVertexStreamPositionColored](a383c1a4-df45-0a71-4b03-fca1194dcd36.htm) | Gets a stream that can be used to write vertices of type  [VertexPositionColored](f99deacd-3167-46ff-6abf-5d27bdbd2c6a.htm)  into the buffer. |
| Public method | [GetVertexStreamPositionNormal](75da6967-bc49-85f8-5630-7a13dc679609.htm) | Gets a stream that can be used to write vertices of type  [VertexPositionNormal](a40efda7-6e2f-a455-f65e-02b10b0bc1b4.htm)  into the buffer. |
| Public method | [GetVertexStreamPositionNormalColored](b4ee5ac8-8fad-4861-01c4-b249e1d40c0f.htm) | Gets a stream that can be used to write vertices of type  [VertexPositionNormalColored](aa354e03-2b25-b5a4-5634-c3518518c0d3.htm)  into the buffer. |
| Public method | [IsValid](82448bdd-a0a4-61f2-fbbd-91a4988f6ce6.htm) | Tests whether the buffer is valid for rendering. |
| Public method | [Map](25906237-dd27-22a6-96cf-c480869fe02b.htm) | Maps a portion of the buffer into memory, so that vertex data can be written into it. (see  [VertexStream](a7a2d911-e3e4-84a7-a0c2-6aa5a28ae2ed.htm)  ). |
| Public method | [ToString](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7bxwbwt2) | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from  [Object](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e5kfa45b)  .) |
| Public method | [Unmap](763dedd5-6fdc-84b8-e3ec-18694d5d3382.htm) | Unmaps the buffer, so that it can be used for rendering. |

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
