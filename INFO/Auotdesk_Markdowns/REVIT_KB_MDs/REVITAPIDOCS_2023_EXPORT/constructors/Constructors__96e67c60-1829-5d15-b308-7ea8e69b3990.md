# Constructors

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ)](b4c1d4ae-613f-979d-65d8-3c099cca6c3f.htm) | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point. |
| Public method | [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ, Boolean)](349bf4ad-de49-f6fe-f223-6d782b70570f.htm) | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point, with the option to invert the filter and match all elements with a bounding box that do not contain the given point. |
| Public method | [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ, Double)](2d8feb9b-f5db-35b7-fef7-98c9ed0c5cce.htm) | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point, while specifying the tolerance to be used in deciding if the point matches the criteria. |
| Public method | [BoundingBoxContainsPointFilter(XYZ, Double, Boolean)](d2891b1c-b50c-cadc-addf-9256d44efd12.htm) | Constructs a new instance of a filter to match elements with a bounding box that contains the given point, while specifying the tolerance to be used in deciding if the point matches the criteria. This constructor includes the option to invert the filter and match all elements with a bounding box that do not contain the given point. |

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public property | [Inverted](ceab2eea-cc4c-d7dc-b34c-b3c1f012eda1.htm) | True if the results of the filter are inverted; elements that would normally be accepted by this filter will be rejected, and elements that would normally be rejected will be accepted. (Inherited from  [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.htm)  .) |
| Public property | [IsValidObject](027ccc75-b7f6-4ee2-cf98-563df96b0dbb.htm) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. (Inherited from  [ElementFilter](b8b46cbf-9ecc-0745-ec53-c3c3b6510113.htm)  .) |
