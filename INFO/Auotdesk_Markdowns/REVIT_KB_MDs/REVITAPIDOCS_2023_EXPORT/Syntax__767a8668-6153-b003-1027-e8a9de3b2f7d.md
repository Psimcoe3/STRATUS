# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double Scale { get; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public ReadOnly Property Scale As Double 	Get ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property double Scale { 	double get (); } ``` |

# Remarks

When the transformation is conformal and can be decomposed as the product of a rigid-body motion, uniform scale and reflection, this property returns the scale value of the uniform scale transformation.

# Exceptions
