# Remarks

When Conceptual Energy Analysis is enabled in Revit Projects, massing faces will be assigned to the subcategories of Mass category that these ConceptualSurfaceType's are associated with. A default ConceptualConstructionType is associated with the ConceptualSurfaceType. This default ConceptualConstructionType is assigned to Mass faces with the corresponding subcategory. Changing the default ConceptualConstructionType associated with the ConceptualSurfaceType will update the ConceptualConstruction type for all Mass faces of that subcategory which the user has not specifically provided an override value for.
