| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property Position As XYZ 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

This is an alternate interface to the property CoordinateSystem.Origin. When set, the effect is the same as setting the CoordinateSystem property to the same as its current value but with a different Origin.
