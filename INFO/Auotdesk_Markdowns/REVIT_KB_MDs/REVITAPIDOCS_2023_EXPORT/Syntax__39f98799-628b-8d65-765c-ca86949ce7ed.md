| Proceed | Instruct the exporter to go on with processing the node. It means the exporter will continue handling the node by processing all its child nodes, if it has any, and their geometry where it is relevant. |
| Skip | Instruct the exporter to skip the node. It means the exporter will not process any child nodes (nor the geometry) of the node. The respective end-node notification will still be invoked though. |
