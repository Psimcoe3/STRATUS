# Remarks

This property will be the first room encountered that contains the instance. If more than one room includes this point in its volume only the first one is returned. If no room is found that contains the instance, this property is    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  . This property should not be used for door or window instances, which are placed on the boundary or between rooms. Use the  [FromRoom](d6658841-da29-ead4-049b-3036cbd4951a.htm)  and  [ToRoom](939e9c7b-072a-7be9-105f-64e1aa1f3a97.htm)  properties instead.
