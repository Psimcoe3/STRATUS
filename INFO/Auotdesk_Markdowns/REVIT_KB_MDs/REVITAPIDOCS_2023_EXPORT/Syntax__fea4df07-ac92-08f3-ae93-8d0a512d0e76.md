  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static IList<ComponentRepeater> RepeatElements( 	Document document, 	ICollection<ElementId> elementIds ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function RepeatElements ( _ 	document As Document, _ 	elementIds As ICollection(Of ElementId) _ ) As IList(Of ComponentRepeater) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static IList<ComponentRepeater^>^ RepeatElements( 	Document^ document,  	ICollection<ElementId^>^ elementIds ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document that contains the elements.

elementIds
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic ICollection   [ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The set of adaptive components used as an input pattern for the repeating operation.

#### Return Value

One or more component repeater objects representing the result pattern of the repeating operation.

# Remarks

All elements must be adaptive family instances and have no shape handles. At least one placement point must be hosted on a 1D or 2D repeating reference. All other placement points can be hosted on a 0D, 1D or 2D repeating reference, or must be unhosted. Use  [CanElementBeRepeated(Document, ElementId)](85030abd-7476-91fc-a67b-50dd8bcf9697.htm)  to test whether an element meets these conditions.
