# Methods

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public method | [Dispose](c9ee1344-bc19-d833-52e7-dcc4931fe085.htm) | (Inherited from  [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.htm)  .) |
| Public method | Equals | Determines whether the specified  Object  is equal to the current  Object  . (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | [GetBasisSurface](5fb55047-9bf3-aa08-a0f6-695916946c30.htm) | Returns a copy of basis surface of this OffsetSurface. |
| Public method | [GetBoundingBoxUV](5084214f-219f-780f-fe03-f16b62b2660d.htm) | Gets the UV bounding box of the surface. (Inherited from  [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.htm)  .) |
| Public method | GetHashCode | Serves as a hash function for a particular type. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | [GetOffsetDistance](580da623-2d47-9eea-e549-497b32a82d03.htm) | Returns offset distance of this OffsetSurface. |
| Public method | GetType | Gets the  Type  of the current instance. (Inherited from  Object  .) |
| Public method | [IsOrientationSameAsBasisSurface](de30829a-52b3-7afc-ff09-0d891621d289.htm) | Indicates whether the orientation of the OffsetSurface is same as that of its basis surface, in the sense that their oriented normals at any (u, v) have the same direction. |
| Public method | [Project](802cc09b-d0a4-dfc5-8ca1-e8c5e8cd4ced.htm) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails. (Inherited from  [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.htm)  .) |
| Public method | [ProjectWithGuessPoint](db8cc42a-9f34-611a-d9c5-852f3935887f.htm) | Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails. (Inherited from  [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.htm)  .) |
| Public method | ToString | Returns a string that represents the current object. (Inherited from  Object  .) |

# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public property | [IsValidObject](6429595a-a6e1-2501-1e60-9c53814a9108.htm) | Specifies whether the .NET object represents a valid Revit entity. (Inherited from  [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.htm)  .) |
| Public property | [OrientationMatchesParametricOrientation](451b549f-2bc4-4f37-9f32-981fe18868a8.htm) | Indicates whether this Surface's orientation is the same as or opposite to its parametric orientation. (Inherited from  [Surface](bb391358-5ca0-578d-e8e2-6d1b30c472d8.htm)  .) |
