#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document containing the elements.

referenceId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The reference view that will be changed to refer to a different View.

desiredViewId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The id of the View that the reference section or callout will refer to.

# Remarks

Reference views may not refer to a View in which their own graphics (such as the section or callout graphics) will appear. If the reference view's ViewFamilyType is not appropriate for the new View, Revit will automatically change the ViewFamilyType during regeneration. This typically occurs when the referenced view is changed from a model View to a drafting View or vice-versa.
