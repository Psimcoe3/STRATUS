# Remarks

VertexFormatBits can be used to specify the vertex format in the creation of the following objects:

1. [EffectInstance](45b7ef37-46b6-6cf4-2f42-c6f4055a170c.htm)
2. [VertexFormat](a946fa2b-bb1f-202c-38dc-8ae0307bedac.htm)

VertexFormatBits is not to be confused with VertexFormat. The latter type of object is associated with low-level graphics functionality and may become invalid. VertexFormat is needed to submit a set of vertex and index buffers for rendering (see  [DrawContext](b9244325-08c8-8bbd-a9f3-5d91d638d85d.htm)  ).
