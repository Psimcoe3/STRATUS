**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double Angle { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property Angle As Double 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property double Angle { 	double get (); 	void set (double value); } ``` |

# Remarks

Angle may be assigned for connectors of some family instances. In order to set this property, it must be mapped to a writable instance parameter in the family definition. For a connector obtained from a non-family instance (for example not a fitting, but instead a pipe, duct, or cable tray), the value will always be zero. Non-zero angles are only valid for family instance fitting connectors.
