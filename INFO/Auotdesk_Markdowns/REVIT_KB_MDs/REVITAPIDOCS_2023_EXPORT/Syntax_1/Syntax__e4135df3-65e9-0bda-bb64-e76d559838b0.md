**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture](720f0c58-cb2b-4f13-374a-7348ed0a1cd3.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public ElementId Start( 	ElementId topoSurfaceId ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Start ( _ 	topoSurfaceId As ElementId _ ) As ElementId ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: ElementId^ Start( 	ElementId^ topoSurfaceId ) ``` |

#### Parameters

topoSurfaceId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The TopographySurface element to be edited.

#### Return Value

The Id of the topography Surface being edited.

# Remarks

The application will need to start a transaction to actually make changes to the TopographySurface element. TopographyEditScope can only be started when there is no transaction active, thus it does not work for commands running in automatic transaction mode. Like all Start methods in any edit scope object this too returns an Id of the element in the edit session, even though in this case here it always equals to the given topoSurfaceId.
