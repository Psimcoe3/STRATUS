| [Transaction Class](308ebf8d-d96d-4643-cd1d-34fffcea53fd.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Starts the transaction.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public TransactionStatus Start() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Start As TransactionStatus ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: TransactionStatus Start() ``` |

#### Return Value

If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Started. Note that unless starting is successful, changes cannot be made to the document.

# Remarks

A transaction may be started only after it was instantiated or after it was previously committed or rolled back. In order to start a transaction, it must have a name assigned. If the name was not specified when the transaction object was instantiated, it has to be set by calling the  [SetName(String)](c0283e7f-d261-6016-724c-31ae5cde96a7.htm)  method.

Be aware that every time a transaction starts,  [Failure Handling Options](c03bb2e5-f679-bf24-4e87-08b3c3a08385.htm)  will be reset to their default values. If a specific failure handling is required, programmers need to use  [SetFailureHandlingOptions(FailureHandlingOptions)](1e913cca-f75b-8dfb-b172-5a04f3732b85.htm)  before the transaction is committed or rolled back.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | Cannot modify the document for either a read-only external command is being executed, or changes to the document are temporarily disabled. -or- The transaction's document is currently in failure mode. No transaction operations are permitted until failure handling is finished. -or- The transaction started already and has not been completed yet. -or- Starting a new transaction is not permitted. It could be because another transaction already started and has not been completed yet, or the document is in a state in which it cannot start a new transaction (e.g. during failure handling or a read-only mode, which could be either permanent or temporary). -or- The transaction does not have a valid name assigned yet. |
