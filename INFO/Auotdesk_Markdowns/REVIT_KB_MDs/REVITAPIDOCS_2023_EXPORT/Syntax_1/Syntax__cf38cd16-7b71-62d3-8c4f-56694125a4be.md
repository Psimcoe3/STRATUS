# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void FinishLoop( 	BRepBuilderGeometryId loopId ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub FinishLoop ( _ 	loopId As BRepBuilderGeometryId _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void FinishLoop( 	BRepBuilderGeometryId^ loopId ) ``` |

#### Parameters

loopId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB BRepBuilderGeometryId](f7d0b679-926a-9f1d-8f2a-dda9c2f3fe7a.htm)    
     Id of the loop.

# Remarks

No functions that modify the given loop's definition should be called after calling this function (e.g.,  [AddCoEdge(BRepBuilderGeometryId, BRepBuilderGeometryId, Boolean)](c4713a48-712b-e293-6745-a266af97e195.htm)  ). The BRepBuilder may take the opportunity to validate some of the loop's data and report any problems it finds.
