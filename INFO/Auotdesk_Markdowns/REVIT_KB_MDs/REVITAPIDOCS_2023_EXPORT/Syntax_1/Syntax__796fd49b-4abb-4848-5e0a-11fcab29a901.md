     The view where visibility control might be allowed.

# Remarks

There are some categories in Revit that are hidden to users in the Object Styles and Visibility dialog. Their visibility cannot be controlled for a particular view. This property identifies if the category allows visibility control (and thus allows the Visible property to be set).
