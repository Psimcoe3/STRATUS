A table supporting a mapping of line weights in Revit to line weight names that will be set in the target export format.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 21.0.0.0 (21.1.1.109)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class ExportLineweightTable : IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<ExportLineweightKey, ExportLineweightInfo>>,  	IDisposable ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class ExportLineweightTable _ 	Implements IEnumerable(Of KeyValuePair(Of ExportLineweightKey, ExportLineweightInfo)),  _ 	IDisposable ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class ExportLineweightTable : IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<ExportLineweightKey^, ExportLineweightInfo^>>,  	IDisposable ``` |

# Remarks

This table is structured as a mapping from  [ExportLineweightKey](5b3250ab-f70b-6f87-afbf-dd049a64c29e.htm)  to  [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.htm)  members. The  [ExportLineweightKey](5b3250ab-f70b-6f87-afbf-dd049a64c29e.htm)  contains the identification information for the pattern table: the Revit line weight. The  [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.htm)  contains the line weight to use in the export format.

The table can be accessed via direct iteration as a collection of KeyValuePairs, or by traversal of the stored keys obtained from GetKeys(), or via specific lookup of a key constructed externally. In all cases, the  [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.htm)  returned will be a copy of the  [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.htm)  from the table. In order to make changes to the  [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.htm)  and use those settings during export, set the modified  [ExportLineweightInfo](730cd713-bb8b-8a69-739e-d9bae8eb6fa5.htm)  back into the table using the same key.
