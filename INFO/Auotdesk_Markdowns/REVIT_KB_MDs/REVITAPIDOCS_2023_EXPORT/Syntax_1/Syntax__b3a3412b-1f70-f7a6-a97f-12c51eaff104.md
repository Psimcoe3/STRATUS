# Remarks

When true, the TaskDialog will display a progress bar that has an indeterminate start and stop.

A progress bar is a window that an application can use to indicate the progress of a lengthy operation.

It consists of a rectangle that is animated as an operation progresses. The animation continues until the TaskDialog is closed.

The default value is false.
