Checks if rebarShape matches curves and hooks. If the RebarShapeDefinesHooks flag in ReinforcementSettings has been set to false, then this method will ignore the hook information.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure](d586b341-f687-9d90-e96d-255806b7d4fc.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2013

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static bool RebarShapeMatchesCurvesAndHooks( 	RebarShape rebarShape, 	RebarBarType barType, 	XYZ norm, 	IList<Curve> curves, 	RebarHookType startHook, 	RebarHookType endHook, 	RebarHookOrientation startHookOrient, 	RebarHookOrientation endHookOrient ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |

#### Parameters

rebarShape
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarShape](0a370e32-eaba-785e-7e1f-9330929525fc.htm)    
     A RebarShape element that defines the shape of the rebar.

barType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarBarType](467b44cc-54e7-3ecf-07e1-ad15d05fe800.htm)    
     A RebarBarType element that defines bar diameter, bend radius and material of the rebar.

norm
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The normal to the plane that the rebar curves lie on.

curves
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     An array of curves that define the shape of the rebar curves. They must belong to the plane defined by the normal and origin. Bends and hooks should not be included in the array of curves.

startHook
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.htm)    
     A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the start of the bar.

endHook
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookType](3c7a78d5-f92b-e58b-e7c9-7927537498fd.htm)    
     A RebarHookType element that defines the hook for the end of the bar.

startHookOrient
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.htm)    
     Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the start of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the first curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up."

endHookOrient
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure RebarHookOrientation](e8365754-0811-8d4e-864a-55bf34af3a87.htm)    
     Defines the orientation of the hook plane at the end of the rebar with respect to the orientation of the last curve and the plane normal. Only two values are permitted: Value = Right: The hook is on your right as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up." Value = Left: The hook is on your left as you stand at the end of the bar, with the bar behind you, taking the bar's normal as "up."

#### Return Value

True if rebarShape matches curves and hooks.
