# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public RebarFreeFormValidationResult AddBarGeometry( 	IList<Curve> curves ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function AddBarGeometry ( _ 	curves As IList(Of Curve) _ ) As RebarFreeFormValidationResult ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: RebarFreeFormValidationResult AddBarGeometry( 	IList<Curve^>^ curves ) ``` |

#### Parameters

curves
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     Curves describing one bar in the set.

#### Return Value

Returns Success if everything is ok, otherwise the failure reason.

# Remarks

This function will can fail due to following reasons:

* One or more of the input curves was null.
* One or more of the input curves was unbounded.
* Curves doesn't form a valid curve loop, it forms 0, 2 or more curve loops.
* A rebar constructed from curves can't be bent according to the bending radius.
