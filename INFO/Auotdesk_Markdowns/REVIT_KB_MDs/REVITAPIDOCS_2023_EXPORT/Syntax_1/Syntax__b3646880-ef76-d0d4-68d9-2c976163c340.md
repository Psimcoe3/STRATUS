| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | document is not a project document. -or- The ElementId ownerViewId does not correspond to a View. -or- The ElementId ownerViewId is a view template. -or- The ElementId ownerViewId is a perspective view. -or- The 3D view ownerViewId is not locked. -or- The input 3D view cannot be used to place a MultiReferenceAnnotation object. -or- dimension line direction and dimension plane normal are not orthogonal. -or- There is at least one element that doesn't match the reference category of the MultiReferenceAnnotationType, or there are no elements. -or- for DimensionStyleType LinearFixed dimensions the dimension line direction must be parallel to either the view's vertical or horizontal direction. -or- some references can't be used with a DimensionStyleType Linear dimension of this direction. References must either appear as points in the view or be linear references which are perpendicular to the dimension line. -or- some references can't be used with a DimensionStyleType LinearFixed dimension. Only references which appear as points in the view can be used. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
