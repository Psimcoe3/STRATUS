# Remarks

ElevationMarkers store the ViewFamilyType which will be used by all elevations hosted on the ElevationMarker. The orientation of an ElevationMarker is determined by the orientation of the views it hosts. You can check the orientation of any view by getting View.ViewDirection. To reorient the ElevationMarker and all of the views it hosts, call ElementTransformUtils.RotateElement with the ElevationMarker as an argument.
