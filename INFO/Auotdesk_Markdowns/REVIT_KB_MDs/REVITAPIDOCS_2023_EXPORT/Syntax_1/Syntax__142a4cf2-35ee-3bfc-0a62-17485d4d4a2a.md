#### Parameters

wall
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Wall](b5891733-c602-12df-beab-da414b58d608.htm)    
     The wall.

curve
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The wall's base curve.

#### Return Value

True if the wall's base can be represented by a direct thickening of the wall's base curve. False if the wall's base shape is affected by other geometry, and thus cannot be represented by a direct thickening of the wall's base cure.
