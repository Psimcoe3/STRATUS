#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document to which the new reference callout will be added.

parentViewId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The view in which the callout symbol appears. Callouts can be created in FloorPlan, CeilingPlan, StructuralPlan, Section, Elevation, Drafting, and Detail views.

viewIdToReference
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The view which will be referenced. The ViewFamilyType of the referenced view will be used by the new reference callout. Only cropped views can be referenced, unless the referenced view is a Drafting view. Drafting views can always be referenced regardless of the parent view type. Elevation views can be referenced from Elevation and Drafting parent views. Section views can be referenced from Section and Drafting parent views. Detail views can be referenced from all parent views except for in FloorPlan, CeilingPlan and StructuralPlan parent views where only horizontally-oriented Detail views can be referenced. FloorPlan, CeilingPlan and StructuralPlan views can be referenced from FloorPlan, CeilingPlan and StructuralPlan parent views.

point1
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     One corner of the callout symbol in the parent view.

point2
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The other diagonally opposed corner of the callout symbol in the parent view.

# Remarks

The reference callout will assume the ViewFamilyType of the view it references. The corners of the callout symbol will be determined by the two point arguments. The sides of the callout symbol will be aligned to the sides of the parent view's crop region.

# Exceptions
