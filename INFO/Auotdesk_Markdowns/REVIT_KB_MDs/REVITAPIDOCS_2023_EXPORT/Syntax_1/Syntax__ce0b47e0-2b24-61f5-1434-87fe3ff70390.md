A surface of revolution defined by a profile curve and a local coordinate system. The surface is obtained by rotating the curve around Z axis of the local coordinate system.

# Syntax

| C# |

| ``` public class RevolvedSurface : Surface ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |

| ``` Public Class RevolvedSurface _ 	Inherits Surface ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public ref class RevolvedSurface : public Surface ``` |

# Remarks

The parametric equation of a surface of revolution is S(u, v) = center + C1(v)\*cos(u)\*xVec + C1(v)\*sin(u)\*yVec + C2(v)\*zVec, where the profile curve in the SurfRev's xz plane has the parametric equation (C1(t), C2(t)). Note that the direction of X axis may agree or disagree with the chosen orientation of the surface.
