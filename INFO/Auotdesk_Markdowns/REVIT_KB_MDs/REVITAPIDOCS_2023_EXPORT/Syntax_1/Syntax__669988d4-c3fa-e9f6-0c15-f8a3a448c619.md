# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool SuppressLeadingZeros { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property SuppressLeadingZeros As Boolean 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property bool SuppressLeadingZeros { 	bool get (); 	void set (bool value); } ``` |

#### Field Value

True if leading zeros should be suppressed, false otherwise. The default is false.

# Remarks

This property is applicable to display units related to feet and fractional inches:

* DUT\_FEET\_FRACTIONAL\_INCHES
* DUT\_RISE\_OVER\_FOOT
* DUT\_RISE\_OVER\_10\_FEET

When SuppressLeadingZeros is true:

* If the foot component of the value is zero (the value is less than one foot), it will not be displayed. For example, 0' - 2 3/4" will be displayed as 2 3/4".
* If both the foot and integer inch components of the value are zero (the value is less than one inch), neither will be displayed. For example, 0' - 0 3/4" will be displayed as 3/4".
* However, an integer inch component of zero will be displayed if the foot component is non-zero. For example 1' - 0 3/4" will be displayed as 1' - 0 3/4".
