# Remarks

Titles of task dialogs should be unique. Do not reuse the same title for multiple task dialogs.

Newline characters are not allowed in Title.

When the dialogs is shown, Revit will put "External Command Name –" or "External Application –" in the front of the value by default. Examples:

* Plug-in Name – No Rooms to Calculate
* Plug-in Name – Invalid Value for Length

You can suppress it by setting TitleAutoPrefix to false.

Titles should describe the nature of the problem or state the situation that currently exists. The title tells the user why they are getting the message, not what they are supposed to do.
