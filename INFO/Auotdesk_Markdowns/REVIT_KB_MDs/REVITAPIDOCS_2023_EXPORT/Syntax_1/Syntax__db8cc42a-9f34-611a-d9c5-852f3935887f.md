Project a 3D point orthogonally onto a surface (to find the nearest point). This method is meant to be used when a good approximate solution for the projection is available. Throws InvalidOperationException if the projection fails.

| ``` Public Sub ProjectWithGuessPoint ( _ 	point As XYZ, _ 	guessUV As UV, _ 	<OutAttribute> ByRef uv As UV, _ 	<OutAttribute> ByRef distance As Double _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void ProjectWithGuessPoint( 	XYZ^ point,  	UV^ guessUV,  	[OutAttribute] UV^% uv,  	[OutAttribute] double% distance ) ``` |

#### Parameters

point
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The point to project.

guessUV
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB UV](1724be37-059b-91ff-aa74-d1508082f76d.htm)    
     The calculation will look for a project near the provided UV.

uv
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB UV](1724be37-059b-91ff-aa74-d1508082f76d.htm)   %    
     The surface coordinates of the projected point.

distance
:   Type:  System Double   %    
     Holds the distance from input point to its projection.
