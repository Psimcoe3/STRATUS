  **Since:**  2016 Subscription Release

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static void RotateConnectedPartByConnector( 	Document doc, 	Connector conn, 	double axisRotationBy ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Sub RotateConnectedPartByConnector ( _ 	doc As Document, _ 	conn As Connector, _ 	axisRotationBy As Double _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static void RotateConnectedPartByConnector( 	Document^ doc,  	Connector^ conn,  	double axisRotationBy ) ``` |

#### Parameters

doc
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document.

conn
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.htm)    
     The connected connector of the fabrication part to be rotated.

axisRotationBy
:   Type:  System Double    
     The angle in radians to rotate by.

# Remarks

Attempts to resize rectangular and oval ends if the angle is a multiple of PI/2. Taps cannot be rotated. For rectangular and oval profiles only 90, 180 and 270 degree rotations are valid.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | For rectangular and oval parts the axis rotation must be a multiple of PI/2. -or- The connector does not belong to a fabrication part. -or- Connector is not connected. -or- Connector belongs to a fabrication part tap. -or- Fabrication part cannot be rotated because it is either unable to be re-sized or it is too constrained. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | rotate failed because the fabrication part geometry could not be modified accordingly. |
