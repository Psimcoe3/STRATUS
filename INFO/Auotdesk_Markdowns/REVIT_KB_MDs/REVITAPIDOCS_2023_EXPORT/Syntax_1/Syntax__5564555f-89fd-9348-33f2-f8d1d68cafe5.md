# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class MEPAnalyticalConnection : MEPCurve ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class MEPAnalyticalConnection _ 	Inherits MEPCurve ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class MEPAnalyticalConnection : public MEPCurve ``` |

# Remarks

The analytical connection takes mechanical equipment into account of network flow/pressure analysis. The connection remains the same even if the mechanical equipment moves and rotates. It enables a fast establishment of piping network to analyze the flow and pressure, especially at the early stage of the design process.
