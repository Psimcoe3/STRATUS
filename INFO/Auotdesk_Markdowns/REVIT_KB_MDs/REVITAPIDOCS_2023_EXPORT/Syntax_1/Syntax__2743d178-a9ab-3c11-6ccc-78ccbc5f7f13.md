| ``` public: static bool ConnectDuctPlaceholdersAtTee( 	Document^ document,  	Connector^ connector1,  	Connector^ connector2,  	Connector^ connector3 ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document.

connector1
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.htm)    
     The end connector of the first placeholder.

connector2
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.htm)    
     The end connector of second placeholder.

connector3
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Connector](11e07082-b3f2-26a1-de79-16535f44716c.htm)    
     The end connector of the third placeholder.

#### Return Value

True if connection succeeds, false otherwise.

# Remarks

The three placeholders may or may not have physical connections. However, the first connector should be collinear with the second connector, and the third connector must have be able to be extended to have an intersection with first and second.

If first placeholder and second placeholder have the same size, the second one is merged with first one and original placeholder element will become invalid. If connection fails, the placeholders cannot be physically connected.
