# Remarks

An affine transform is a linear transform plus a translation (which may be zero). 1D space is tranformed according to the following formula: t -> A\*t + B where A and B are constants. Some functions only accept certain kinds of transform (e.g., rigid motion, conformal, non-singular, etc.).
