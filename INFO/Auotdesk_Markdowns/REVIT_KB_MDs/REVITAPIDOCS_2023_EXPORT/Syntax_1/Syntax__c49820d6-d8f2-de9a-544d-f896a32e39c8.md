# Syntax

# Remarks

Families containing large sketches (typically with 300+ elements) may cause performance problems in parametric families (see  [IsParametric](1d4166dd-057d-9d9b-e28f-7bd250bbe587.htm)  ). Thus, before adding any constraints to a family (which will make the family parametric,) this method can be queried and the decision about whether the family should indeed be turned parametric may be deferred to the end-user.
