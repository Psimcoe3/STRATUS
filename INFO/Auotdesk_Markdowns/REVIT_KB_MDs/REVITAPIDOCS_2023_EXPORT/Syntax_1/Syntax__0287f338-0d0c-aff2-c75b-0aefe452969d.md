#### Return Value

True if the transaction has already been committed or rolled back, False otherwise.

# Remarks

A transaction is ended by completing either the 'Commit' or 'RollBack' method. Another way of testing whether a transaction has ended is by testing the current status (see  [GetStatus](fdf98941-eee4-d8af-e3f7-5b6c7ccc3c74.htm)  ). It must be either 'TransactionStatus.Committed' or 'TransactionStatus.RolledBack'
