When %dockPosition% is Floating, this rectangle determines the size and position of the pane. Coordinates are relative to the upper-left-hand corner of the main Revit window. Note: the returned Rectangle is a copy. In order to change the pane state, you must call SetFloatingRectangle with a modified rectangle.
