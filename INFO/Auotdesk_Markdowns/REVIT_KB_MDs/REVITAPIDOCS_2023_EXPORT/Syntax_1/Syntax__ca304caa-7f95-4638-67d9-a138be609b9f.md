| ``` public: static FilledRegion^ Create( 	Document^ document,  	ElementId^ typeId,  	ElementId^ viewId,  	IList<CurveLoop^>^ boundaries ) ``` |

#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document in which to create the filled region.

typeId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The filled region type Id.

viewId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The view Id.

boundaries
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)    
     The boundaries.

#### Return Value

The newly created filled region.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The document is a 3d model family. -or- The Id typeId is invalid. -or- Details can't be drawn in the view. -or- Masking regions and Filled regions can't be created in this document or view. -or- The input curve loops cannot compose a valid boundary, that means: the "curveLoops" collection is empty; or some curve loops intersect with each other; or each curve loop is not closed individually; or each curve loop is not planar; or each curve loop is not in a plane parallel to the view's detail sketch plane; or input curves contain at least one helical curve. -or- Thrown if the viewId or typeId is invalid, or the view does not support the detail items creation, or if the boundaries are empty, open, or self-intersecting. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
