| --- |
| [CurveLoop Class](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Determines if this CurveLoop is oriented counter-clockwise (CCW) or clockwise (CW) with respect to the specified 3D direction.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2012

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool IsCounterclockwise( 	XYZ normal ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function IsCounterclockwise ( _ 	normal As XYZ _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool IsCounterclockwise( 	XYZ^ normal ) ``` |

#### Parameters

normal
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The normal vector to the plane used for this determination.

#### Return Value

True if the curve loop is oriented counter-clockwise with respect to the specified 3D direction, false if the loop is oriented clockwise.

# Remarks

CCW means that the projection of the CurveLoop onto a plane having "normal" as its oriented normal is CCW. This method should only be called if the loop is closed and has a non-singular projection onto the plane (i.e., the projection should have no self-intersections and should not be degenerate or even nearly degenerate). The return value in other cases is indeterminate.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | The curve loop is open or consists of a single unbound curve; counterclockwise determination has no meaning. |
