# Remarks

When this setting is false, the user cannot select most pinned elements in canvas. This option helps users avoid accidentally moving important pinned objects such as levels and grids. When this option is true, the user can select pinned elements directly.

Note that to improve usability, the behavior of this option has some added intelligence beyond simply checking whether the element is pinned. For example, if a model group is pinned, the corresponding attached detail group is not selectable if selection of pinned elements is disabled. To check whether a particular element is pinned for purposes of this setting, see  [ElementSelectsAsPinned(Document, Element)](97efea2e-4101-c63d-ba3b-a3b9a67e3b01.htm)  .
