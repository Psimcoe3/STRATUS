This overload applies only to 2D family symbols (detail components, annotation symbols, titleblocks, etc.). The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods.
