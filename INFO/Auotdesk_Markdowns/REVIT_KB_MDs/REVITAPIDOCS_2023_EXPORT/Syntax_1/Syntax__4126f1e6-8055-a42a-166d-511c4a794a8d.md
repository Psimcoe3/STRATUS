# Remarks

An instance of this class may be used to assign a contextual help location to any RibbonItem (through the RibbonItem.SetContextualHelp() method). It is also possible to use an instance of this class to launch the help path and topic at any time (this permits association of help topics with user interface components inside dialogs created by the add-in application).
