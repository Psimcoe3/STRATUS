#### Parameters

sourceView

     The source view

#### Return Value

The transformation from source view to destination view.

# Remarks

Both source and destination views must be 2D graphics views capable of drawing details and view-specific elements (floor and ceiling plans, elevations, sections, drafting views.) The result is a transformation needed to copy an element from drawing plane of the source view to the drawing plane of the destination view. The destination view can be in the same document as the source view. The destination view can be the same as the source view.
