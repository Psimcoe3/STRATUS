# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static bool SetLocationPathForSpiralRun( 	StairsRun stairsRun, 	XYZ center, 	double radius, 	double startAngle, 	double includedAngle, 	bool clockwise, 	StairsRunJustification justification ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function SetLocationPathForSpiralRun ( _ 	stairsRun As StairsRun, _ 	center As XYZ, _ 	radius As Double, _ 	startAngle As Double, _ 	includedAngle As Double, _ 	clockwise As Boolean, _ 	justification As StairsRunJustification _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static bool SetLocationPathForSpiralRun( 	StairsRun^ stairsRun,  	XYZ^ center,  	double radius,  	double startAngle,  	double includedAngle,  	bool clockwise,  	StairsRunJustification justification ) ``` |

#### Parameters

stairsRun
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture StairsRun](ea0e49a0-a007-79d0-c902-a24b1359ae28.htm)    
     The run whose location path will be set.

center
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The center of the location arc of the spiral run. The Z coordinate of the center is the base elevation for the new run (in model coordinates). It must be greater than or equal to the stairs base elevation.

radius
:   Type:  System Double    
     The radius of the location arc of the spiral run.

startAngle
:   Type:  System Double    
     The start angle of the location arc of the spiral run. The angle's coordinate system is world coordinate system which always is XYZ.BasisX and XYZ.BasisY.

includedAngle
:   Type:  System Double    
     The total angle covered by the spiral run. Must be a positive value (direction is determined by the clockwise flag).

clockwise
:   Type:  System Boolean    
     True if the spiral run will be created along clockwise direction, False otherwise.

justification
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture StairsRunJustification](4d75bda7-267b-dc0e-286a-b5efb839655f.htm)    
     The location path justification of the new stairs run.

#### Return Value

Indicate if set is success or not.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The given value for startAngle is not finite -or- The input center is not a valid center for spiral run (probably the Z coordinate doesn't meet the restrictions) -or- The includedAngle doesn't satisfy riser restriction to generate spiral run (probably it's too small). |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm) | The given value for radius must be greater than 0 and no more than 30000 feet. -or- The given value for includedAngle must be positive. -or- A value passed for an enumeration argument is not a member of that enumeration |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentsInconsistentException](05972c68-fa6d-3a83-d720-ad84fbc4780f.htm) | The radius is too small to generate a spiral run at the given justification. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | The stairs element represented by stairsRun is not in an active StairsEditScope. The run cannot be modified. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions RegenerationFailedException](787bb389-74c2-5ce7-cdd6-32211209ded2.htm) | The center, radius, startAngle, includedAngle don't satisfy restrictions to generate spiral run. |
