| ``` public CompoundStructure GetCompoundStructure() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetCompoundStructure As CompoundStructure ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public: CompoundStructure^ GetCompoundStructure() ``` |

# Remarks

A copy of the compound structure is returned and changes made to it will not apply to the type until SetCompoundStructure is called. From this object the layers of a compound structure can be accessed. If the element does not have a compound structure then this method will return    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  .
