| Visible | The geometry object is always visible. This type of geometry is always returned by  [Geometry Options](d8a55a5b-2a69-d5ab-3e1f-6cf1ee43c8ec.htm) |
| Highlight | The geometry object is visible, but is affected by highlight or prehighlight special coloration. This type of geometry is returned by  [Geometry Options](d8a55a5b-2a69-d5ab-3e1f-6cf1ee43c8ec.htm)  if  [IncludeNonVisibleObjects](0d277b80-d5e5-1151-d413-b0899da0976f.htm)  is true. |
| Contextual | The geometry object is visible in some contexts, but not in others. This type of geometry is always returned by  [Geometry Options](d8a55a5b-2a69-d5ab-3e1f-6cf1ee43c8ec.htm)  , even when Revit is in a context where the geometry should not be visible, but only if  [IncludeNonVisibleObjects](0d277b80-d5e5-1151-d413-b0899da0976f.htm)  is true. Examples of geometry of this class include Solids representing insulation and lining for MEP ducts and pipes. |
| Invisible | The geometry object is never visible. This type of geometry is never returned by  [Geometry Options](d8a55a5b-2a69-d5ab-3e1f-6cf1ee43c8ec.htm)  but may be obtained by other API operations. |
