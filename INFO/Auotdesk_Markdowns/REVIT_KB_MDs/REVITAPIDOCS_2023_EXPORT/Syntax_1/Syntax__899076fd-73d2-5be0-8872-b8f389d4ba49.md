| ``` public FamilyInstance NewFamilyInstance( 	Line line, 	FamilySymbol symbol, 	View specView ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function NewFamilyInstance ( _ 	line As Line, _ 	symbol As FamilySymbol, _ 	specView As View _ ) As FamilyInstance ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: FamilyInstance^ NewFamilyInstance( 	Line^ line,  	FamilySymbol^ symbol,  	View^ specView ) ``` |

#### Parameters

line
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Line](e7329450-434a-918b-661c-65e15e0585a5.htm)    
     The line location of family instance. The line must in the plane of the view.

symbol
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.htm)    
     A family symbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.

specView
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.htm)    
     A 2D view in which to display the family instance.

# Remarks

This overload applies only to 2D family line based detail symbols. The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods.
