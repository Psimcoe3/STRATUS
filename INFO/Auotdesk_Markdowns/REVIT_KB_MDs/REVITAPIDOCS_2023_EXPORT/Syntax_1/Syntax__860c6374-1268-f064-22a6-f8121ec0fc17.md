# Remarks

A report instance is typically created to request a new systems analysis. The default values include the weather file "USA\_CO\_Denver.Intl.AP.725650\_TMY3.epw" and the workflow file "HVAC Systems Loads and Sizing.osw". Both are part of the Revit installation. The default output folder is the system TEMP folder.
