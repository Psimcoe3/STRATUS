Publish coordinates to the specified ProjectLocation of the link instance.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2018

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void PublishCoordinates( 	LinkElementId locationId ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub PublishCoordinates ( _ 	locationId As LinkElementId _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void PublishCoordinates( 	LinkElementId^ locationId ) ``` |

#### Parameters

locationId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB LinkElementId](6e18abde-8787-9906-8576-ab0c9c5432c6.htm)    
     The  ElementId  of the  ProjectLocation  in the linked document, to which the transform would be published to.

# Remarks

The host project's True North and shared origin are recorded in the linked project, based on the current position of the linked instance. This location is now named in both the host project and the linked project. More than one position of the link can be recorded.

When you publish shared coordinates from a host Revit project to a linked DWG, this changes the linked DWG. The origin of the host Revit project's shared coordinate system becomes the origin of a new User Coordinate System (UCS) in the DWG file. The Y axis of the new UCS corresponds to the host project's True North. You can name the UCS when you publish coordinates. It is not recommended that you change this name after publishing coordinates.

Note: Currently, only  RevitLinkInstance  is supported. DWG link instance, which is  ImportInstance  is not supported now. Passing in an locationId that points to an ImportInstance would result an  ArgumentException  .
