# Syntax

| Visual Basic |

# Remarks

The class contains a KeyBasedTreeEntries object which should hold the KeyBasedTreeEntries data generated by the IExternalResourceServer.

An ExternalResourceServer can create the KeyBasedTreeEntries from an arbitrary data source by using AddEntry to add individual KeyBasedTreeEntries. Once all the desired entries have been added, BuildEntries can be called to construct the KeyBasedTreeEntries object from the individual entries that were added.

KeyBasedTreeEntriesLoadContent must have a built KeyBasedTreeEntries before its LoadStatus property can be set to ExternalResourceLoadStatus.Success.
