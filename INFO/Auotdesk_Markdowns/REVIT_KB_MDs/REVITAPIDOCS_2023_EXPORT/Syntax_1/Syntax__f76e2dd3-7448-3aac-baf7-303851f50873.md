Loads or reloads the Revit link. The link will be loaded from the location given in the input ExternalResourceReference.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public LinkLoadResult LoadFrom( 	ExternalResourceReference resourceReference, 	WorksetConfiguration config ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function LoadFrom ( _ 	resourceReference As ExternalResourceReference, _ 	config As WorksetConfiguration _ ) As LinkLoadResult ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: LinkLoadResult^ LoadFrom( 	ExternalResourceReference^ resourceReference,  	WorksetConfiguration^ config ) ``` |

#### Parameters

resourceReference
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ExternalResourceReference](ffad9c15-8fc9-fbfd-f328-101533f4cf74.htm)    
     An external resource reference describing the source of the linked Revit document.

config
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB WorksetConfiguration](eefef6f4-0892-4bb5-8840-5e99aebc65c9.htm)    

    A WorksetConfiguration object indicating which worksets in the link to open.

    If you want to load the same set of worksets the link previously had, leave this argument as    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  .

#### Return Value

An object containing the ElementId of the link and an enum value indicating any errors which occurred while trying to load.

# Remarks

If the link is currently loaded, Revit must unload the link before reloading it. Any changes made in-memory to the link's shared coordinates will be discarded.

Revit does not try to validate that the input represents the "same" document. You can load a completely different document, which may invalidate references to linked elements.

This function regenerates the document.

The document's Undo history will be cleared by this command. As a result, this command and others executed before it cannot be undone. All transaction phases (e.g. transactions transaction groups and sub-transaction) that were explicitly started must be finished prior to calling this method.
