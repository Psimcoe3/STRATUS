  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool IsTranslation { get; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public ReadOnly Property IsTranslation As Boolean 	Get ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property bool IsTranslation { 	bool get (); } ``` |

# Remarks

This property is true if the only effect of transformation is translation. It checks that the basis of the transform is identity. The translation vector may be zero (which would make this an identity transformation) or nonzero (which would make this a non-trivial translation).
