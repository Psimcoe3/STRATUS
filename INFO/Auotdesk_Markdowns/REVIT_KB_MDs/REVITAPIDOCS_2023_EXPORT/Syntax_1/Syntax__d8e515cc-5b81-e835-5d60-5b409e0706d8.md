  **Since:**  2018

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` void RenderScene( 	View dBView, 	DisplayStyle displayStyle ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Sub RenderScene ( _ 	dBView As View, _ 	displayStyle As DisplayStyle _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` void RenderScene( 	View^ dBView,  	DisplayStyle displayStyle ) ``` |

#### Parameters

dBView
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.htm)    
     The view where rendering will occur.

displayStyle
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB DisplayStyle](c12fdb48-6127-0e0e-0fdc-9f370beb74ca.htm)    
     The display style of the view in which the submitted geometry will be drawn.

# Remarks

The representation of geometry is in terms of a set of vertex and index buffers. The server can use facilities in Autodesk::Revit::DB::DirectContext3D::DrawContext to create the buffers and fill them with data that encode primitives such as triangles, lines, and points. The server can also adjust the geometry that it submits based on the argument to RenderScene() and in response to certain rendering parameters whose values are available through DrawContext (e.g., clip planes).

The final step in the process of submitting geometry for rendering is to call DrawContext::FlushBuffer() for the appropriate buffers.

This interface method may be called in a separate thread from the others.
