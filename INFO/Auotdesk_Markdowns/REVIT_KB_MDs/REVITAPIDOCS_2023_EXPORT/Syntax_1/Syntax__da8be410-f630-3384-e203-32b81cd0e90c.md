| [BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry Class](b0051e1b-8b8b-f819-78c2-67053dd7a241.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Construct BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry based on any GCurve, including GLine and GArc. The curve will be simplified if possible, and the concrete type of the returned value will reflect that simplification: BRepBuilderLinearEdgeGeometry if the curve could be simplified to a line, BRepBuilderArcEdgeGeometry if it could be simplified to an arc, BRepBuilderGenericCurveEdgeGeometry otherwise.

# Syntax

| C# |

| ``` public static BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry Create( 	Curve curve ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	curve As Curve _ ) As BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry^ Create( 	Curve^ curve ) ``` |

#### Parameters

curve
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The 3D curve for this edge. This BRepBuilderEdgeGeometry stores a copy of the input curve. The use of isCurveOpenOrShort as a validator instead of isCurveOpen is a compromise to allow the creation of geometry that is normally considered unacceptable due to edges that are shorter than Revit allows.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The input curve is not bound. -or- The curve is degenerate (its length is too close to zero). -or- The endpoints of the curve are close enough that Revit considers it a closed curve. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
