#### CreateViaThicken Method (CurveLoop, Double, XYZ)

---



|  |
| --- |
| [CurveLoop Class](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Creates a new closed curve loop by thickening the input open curve loop with respect to a given plane.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static CurveLoop CreateViaThicken( 	CurveLoop curveLoop, 	double thickness, 	XYZ normal ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateViaThicken ( _ 	curveLoop As CurveLoop, _ 	thickness As Double, _ 	normal As XYZ _ ) As CurveLoop ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static CurveLoop^ CreateViaThicken( 	CurveLoop^ curveLoop,  	double thickness,  	XYZ^ normal ) ``` |

#### Parameters

curveLoop
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB CurveLoop](84824924-cb89-9e20-de6e-3461f429dfd6.htm)    
     The input curve loop.

thickness
:   Type:  System Double    
     The distance between the offset curves created on either side of the input curve.

normal
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The normal vector to the plane used for thickening.

#### Return Value

The new curve loop.

# Remarks

The new loop will be created via offsets of the input curve loop (in the plane of the normal vector) with the endpoints connected with lines.The original curve loop will be at the center of the new loop.

If the curve loop contains curves such as elliptical segments or splines, it is possible the offset creation will fail if Revit will not be able to trim contiguous curves to meet one another. If the offset is successful, offsets of those curve types will be created as HermiteSplines.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The input thickness is too short for a curve. -or- the curve loop is not marked as open. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | Throws if the input curve could not be thickened. |
