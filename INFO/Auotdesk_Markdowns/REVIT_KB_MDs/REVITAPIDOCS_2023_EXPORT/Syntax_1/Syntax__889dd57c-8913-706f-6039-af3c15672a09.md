| [PointCloudFilterFactory Class](fcbc90c3-0a9d-7522-e483-cad73468d698.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Creates a new point cloud filter based upon planar boundaries.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds](5974062a-47d4-c7bb-16f2-d5dd193bd170.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2012

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static PointCloudFilter CreateMultiPlaneFilter( 	IList<Plane> planes, 	int exactPlaneCount ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateMultiPlaneFilter ( _ 	planes As IList(Of Plane), _ 	exactPlaneCount As Integer _ ) As PointCloudFilter ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static PointCloudFilter^ CreateMultiPlaneFilter( 	IList<Plane^>^ planes,  	int exactPlaneCount ) ``` |

#### Parameters

planes
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [Plane](6a6ee978-f114-558d-3c69-00d289aa855f.htm)    
     All planes used for filtering; positive direction of the normal should point inside the volume of interest.

exactPlaneCount
:   Type:  System Int32    
     This value represents the number of planes (taken in order of their addition) which will be used for exact filtering of individual points. Other planes in the filter will be used for faster, but inexact filtering based on cells.

#### Return Value

Filter object; can be used to get representative set of cloud points passing through the filter.

# Remarks

The filter will check whether a point is located on the "positive" side of each plane, as indicated by the positive direction of the plane normal. Therefore, such filter implicitly defines a volume, which is the intersection of the positive half-spaces corresponding to all the planes. This volume does not have to be closed, but it will always be convex.
