# Remarks

IFC has created a list of common quantities (e.g. length, area, volume, etc.) that can optionally be exported along with the 3D representation for many element types (e.g. walls, columns, doors). Setting this option to true will cause the export procedure to include the set of IFC quantities that Revit currently supports. Default is false.
