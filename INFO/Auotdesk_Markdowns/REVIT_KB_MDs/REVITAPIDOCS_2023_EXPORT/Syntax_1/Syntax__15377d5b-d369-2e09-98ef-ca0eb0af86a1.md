| [Face Class](e32b3b1f-66fc-57cb-6e1c-aa81d1bf3e63.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Returns the normal vector for the face at the given point.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 17.0.0.0 (17.0.1090.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public XYZ ComputeNormal( 	UV point ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function ComputeNormal ( _ 	point As UV _ ) As XYZ ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: XYZ^ ComputeNormal( 	UV^ point ) ``` |

#### Parameters

point
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB UV](1724be37-059b-91ff-aa74-d1508082f76d.htm)    
     The parameters to be evaluated, in natural parameterization of the face.

#### Return Value

The normal vector. This vector will be normalized.

# Remarks

Differs from the normal returned from  [ComputeDerivatives(UV)](77ca18ef-783e-9db5-a37a-2d76f637d1a1.htm)  in that this vector is the "face normal" vector. It will always be oriented to point out of a solid that contains the face.
