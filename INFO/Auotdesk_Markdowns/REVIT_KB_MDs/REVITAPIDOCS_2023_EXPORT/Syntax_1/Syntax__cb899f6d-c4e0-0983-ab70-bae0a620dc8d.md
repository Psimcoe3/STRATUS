| [BRepBuilder Class](94c1fef4-2933-ce67-9c2d-361cbf8a42b4.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Creates an empty face in the geometry being built. Other BRepBuilder methods are used to add loops to the face.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2016

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public BRepBuilderGeometryId AddFace( 	BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry surfaceGeom, 	bool bFaceIsReversed ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function AddFace ( _ 	surfaceGeom As BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry, _ 	bFaceIsReversed As Boolean _ ) As BRepBuilderGeometryId ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: BRepBuilderGeometryId^ AddFace( 	BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry^ surfaceGeom,  	bool bFaceIsReversed ) ``` |

#### Parameters

surfaceGeom
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry](c21d4101-cc15-1990-ee9f-994b487bf95d.htm)    
     The face's support surface.

bFaceIsReversed
:   Type:  System Boolean    
     True if the face's orientation is opposite to that of the surface, false if the orientations agree. The faces of each shell must be consistently oriented. For a solid (BRepType == Solid), the oriented face normals must point out of the solid; for a void (BRepType == Void), the face normals must point into the void. See the description of the bCoEdgeIsReversed input for AddCoEdge() for a discussion of the loop and co-edge orientation conventions to use with the BRepBuilder.

#### Return Value

An id that can be used to identify the face while the BRepBuilder is actively building geometry (e.g., to add a loop to a face).
