# Remarks

Result is based on the ExportComplexity setting. Curtain Walls and Curtain Systems are normally exported as multiple openings, panel by panel, while for energy analysis this can be more simply represented as a single glass surface as large as the entire curtain wall/system. Normally, a curtain wall with 50 panels would be exported as 50 openings. Often, exporting a single opening with the total curtain system area is more appropriate. When this setting is on, one "large" window/opening will be exported for a curtain wall/system.
