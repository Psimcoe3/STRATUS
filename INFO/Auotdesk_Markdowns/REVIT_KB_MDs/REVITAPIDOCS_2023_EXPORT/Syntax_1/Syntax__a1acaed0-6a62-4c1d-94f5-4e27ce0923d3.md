An element that represents a single type with a Family.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |

| ``` public class FamilySymbol : InsertableObject ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |

| ``` Public Class FamilySymbol _ 	Inherits InsertableObject ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public ref class FamilySymbol : public InsertableObject ``` |

# Remarks

Custom families within the Revit API represented by three objects - Family,  FamilySymbol  and  [FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.htm)  . Each object plays a significant part in the structure of families. The Family element represents the entire family that consists of a collection of types, such as an 'I Beam'. You can think of that object as representing the entire family file. The Family object contains a number of  FamilySymbol  elements. The  FamilySymbol  object represents a specific set of family settings within that Family and represents what is known in the Revit user interface as a Type, such as 'W14x32'. The  [FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.htm)  object represents an actual instance of that type placed the Autodesk Revit project. For example the  [FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.htm)  would be a single instance of a W14x32 column within the project.
