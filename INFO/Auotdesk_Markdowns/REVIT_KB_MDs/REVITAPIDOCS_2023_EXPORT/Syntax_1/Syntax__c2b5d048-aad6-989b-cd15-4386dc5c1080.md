Indicates if an analysis should be perform to find the model elements that are part of the building envelope

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Analysis](958e2e12-587d-f188-5d7b-f13d7dbfdf48.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope BuildingEnvelopeDeterminationMethod { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property BuildingEnvelopeDeterminationMethod As gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope BuildingEnvelopeDeterminationMethod { 	gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope get (); 	void set (gbXMLExportBuildingEnvelope value); } ``` |

# Remarks

The analysis is performed for the detailed GreenBuildingXML export and in heating and cooling load calculations. This method uses a combination of ray-casting and flood-fill algorithms in order to find the building elements that are exposed to the outside of the building. Analytical surface originated from the building elements in the envelope will be classified as exterior or shading surfaces.
