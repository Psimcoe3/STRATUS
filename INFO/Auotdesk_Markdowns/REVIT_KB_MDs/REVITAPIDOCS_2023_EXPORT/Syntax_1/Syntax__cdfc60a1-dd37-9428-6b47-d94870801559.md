# Remarks

This property always returns true for model dimensions. It can return false for view-specific dimensions that can lose their references in certain situations. For example, the host element references may not be available when the view containing the dimension is closed. In general, if the host element view-specific geometry is not available, dimensions that reference that geometry will not be able to resolve their references.
