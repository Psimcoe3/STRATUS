Gets Adaptive Point Element Ref ids to which the instance geometry adapts.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2012

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static IList<ElementId> GetInstancePointElementRefIds( 	FamilyInstance famInst ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function GetInstancePointElementRefIds ( _ 	famInst As FamilyInstance _ ) As IList(Of ElementId) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static IList<ElementId^>^ GetInstancePointElementRefIds( 	FamilyInstance^ famInst ) ``` |

#### Parameters

famInst
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.htm)    
     The FamilyInstance.

#### Return Value

The Adaptive Point Element Ref ids to which the instance geometry adapts.

# Remarks

The output contains both placement point ref ids and the shape handles point ref ids. The order corresponds to the same order as that of the Adaptive Points in the Family (which may not be ordered as per their placement number). Will return an empty array if there are no placement points and shape handles. To manipulate such an instance the following methods can be useful: 1) RehostAdaptiveComponentInstanceWithNoPlacementPoints() 2) MoveAdaptiveComponentInstance()
