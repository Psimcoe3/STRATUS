#### Parameters

objectType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.UI.Selection ObjectType](2d0cbbba-d4ab-84b7-b081-36c14769d82c.htm)    
     Specifies the type of object to be selected.

selectionFilter
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.UI.Selection ISelectionFilter](d552f44b-221c-0ecd-d001-41a5099b2f9f.htm)    
     The selection filter.

statusPrompt
:   Type:  [System String](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/s1wwdcbf)    
     The message shown on the status bar.

pPreSelected
:   Type:  [System.Collections.Generic IList](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5y536ey6)   [Reference](d28155ae-817b-1f31-9c3f-c9c6a28acc0d.htm)    
     The previously selected set of objects.

#### Return Value

A collection of references selected by the user.

Note: if the user cancels the operation (for example, through ESC), the method will throw an OperationCanceledException instance.

# Remarks

The user will be shown "Finish" and "Cancel" buttons on the dialog bar to complete the selection operation. Uncheck the "Multiple" check-box to select single object and it will return the selected object directly.

The previously selected set of objects will be highlighted.

Revit users will be permitted to manipulate the Revit view (zooming, panning, and rotating the view), but will not be permitted to click other items in the Revit user interface. Users are not permitted to switch the active view, close the active document or Revit application in the pick session, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

The selection will not be automatically added to the active selection buffer.

Note: this method must not be called during dynamic update, otherwise ForbiddenForDynamicUpdateException will be thrown.
