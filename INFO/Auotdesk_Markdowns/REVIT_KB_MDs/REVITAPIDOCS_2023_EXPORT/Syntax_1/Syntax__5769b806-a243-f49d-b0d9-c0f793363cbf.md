| [AnalyticalMember Class](57c87ac5-a82e-5c7e-2f06-6dbf1f697566.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Gets the member forces associated with this Analytical Member.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure](d586b341-f687-9d90-e96d-255806b7d4fc.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2023

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public IList<MemberForces> GetMemberForces() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetMemberForces As IList(Of MemberForces) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: IList<MemberForces^>^ GetMemberForces() ``` |

#### Return Value

Returns a collection of Member Forces associated with this Analytical Member. Empty collection will be returned if Analytical Member doesn't have any Member Forces. To find out with which end member forces are associated use  [!:Autodesk::Revit::DB::Structure::MemberForces::Position]  property to obtain a position of Member Forces on element.

# Remarks

Member forces are strictly related with releases. This means that we can obtain member forces values only for directions that have releases set to false. Force or moment component on direction that have release set to true is skipped (zeroed) during getting.

# Examples

```
/// <summary>

{
   MemberForces startForces = null;
   if (ams != null)
   {
      IList<MemberForces> beamForces = ams.GetMemberForces();
      foreach (MemberForces forces in beamForces)
      {
         if (forces.Start == true)
         {
            startForces = forces;
            break;
         }
      }
   }

   return startForces;
