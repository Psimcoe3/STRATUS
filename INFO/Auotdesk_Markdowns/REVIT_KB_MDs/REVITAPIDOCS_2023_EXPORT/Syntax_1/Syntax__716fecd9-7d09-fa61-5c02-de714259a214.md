Retrieves a box that circumscribes the solid geometry.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 17.0.0.0 (17.0.1090.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public BoundingBoxXYZ GetBoundingBox() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetBoundingBox As BoundingBoxXYZ ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: BoundingBoxXYZ^ GetBoundingBox() ``` |

# Remarks

The bounding box information is stored as bounds in local coordinates and a transform. So the transform is to be taken in to account when using the bounds. This is different from the bounding box returned by Element.BoundingBox in that the bounding box returned by that routine stores the bounds in modeling coordinates with an identity transform.
