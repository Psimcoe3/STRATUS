#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document to which the new callout will be added.

parentViewId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The view in which the callout appears. Callouts can be created in FloorPlan, CeilingPlan, StructuralPlan, Section, Elevation, and Detail views.

viewFamilyTypeId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     The id of the ViewFamilyType which will be used by the new callout ViewSection. Detail ViewFamilyTypes can be used in all parent views except for CeilingPlan and Drafting views. FloorPlan, CeilingPlan, StructuralPlan, Section, and Elevation ViewFamilyTypes may be be used in parent views that also use a type with the same ViewFamily enum value. For example, in StructuralPlan parent views both StructuralPlan and Detail ViewFamilyTypes are allowed.

point1
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     Determines the extents of the callout symbol in the parent view.

point2
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     Determine the extents of the callout symbol in the parent view.

#### Return Value

The new callout view. The view will be either a ViewSection, ViewPlan or ViewDetail.

# Remarks

The extents of new callout are determined by using the two argument points as the opposing corners of a rectangle which is aligned to the directions of the parent view. The callout's near and far cut planes will match those of the parent view. The new view will receive a unique name.
