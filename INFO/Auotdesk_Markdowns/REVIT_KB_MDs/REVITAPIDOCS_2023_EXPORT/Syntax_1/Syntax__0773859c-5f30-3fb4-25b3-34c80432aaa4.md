# Members

| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Undefined | represents an undefined handle. if this value is returned, then the handle cannot find it's type |
| RebarPlane | Handle controlling the location of the Rebar's primary plane. Drives location of the entire Rebar along the direction of its normal. |
| StartOfBar | Handle controlling start point of the Rebar. |
| EndOfBar | Handle controlling end point of the Rebar. |
| Edge | Handle controlling location of a single edge segment of the Rebar. Drives the edge in the direction perpendicular to the edge and in the Rebar's primary plane. |
| OutOfPlaneExtent | Handle controlling the extent of a three-dimensional Rebar out of its primary plane. This includes the length of a Rebar Set, the out-of-plane length of a multi-planar Rebar, and the length of a spiral Rebar. |
| CustomHandle | Custom handle used in API constraints. The handle itself and the behavior of this type of handle is defined in the API (see  [IRebarUpdateServer](3e845cad-eca0-ccb3-785b-48a32a9f2677.htm)  ). This handle defines a symbolic part of the rebar and is not tied to a specific segment or part of the rebar. Handles that represent the start and end of a bar should not be of this type. |
