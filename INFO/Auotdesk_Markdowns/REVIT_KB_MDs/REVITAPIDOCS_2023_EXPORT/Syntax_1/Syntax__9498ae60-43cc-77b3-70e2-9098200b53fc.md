| --- |
| [Face Class](e32b3b1f-66fc-57cb-6e1c-aa81d1bf3e63.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Calculates the intersection of the specified face with this face and returns the intersection results.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 21.0.0.0 (21.1.1.109)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public FaceIntersectionFaceResult Intersect( 	Face face, 	out Curve result ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Intersect ( _ 	face As Face, _ 	<OutAttribute> ByRef result As Curve _ ) As FaceIntersectionFaceResult ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: FaceIntersectionFaceResult Intersect( 	Face^ face,  	[OutAttribute] Curve^% result ) ``` |

#### Parameters

face
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Face](e32b3b1f-66fc-57cb-6e1c-aa81d1bf3e63.htm)    
     The specified face to intersect with this face.

result
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)   %    
     A single Curve representing the intersection.

#### Return Value

* FaceIntersectionFaceResult.Intersecting - One or more intersections were encountered.
* SetComparisonResult.NonIntersecting - There is no intersection found.

# Remarks

This is not a general-purpose function: it only works properly for simple configurations. For other configurations, it may return an incorrect result. Some configurations for which the function might return a correct result are:

* A planar face that fully intersects another face in a single curve, when the other face is planar or cylindrical.
* A cylindrical face that fully intersects another face in a single curve, when the other face is planar.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | The face is    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  . |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | The intersection calculation fails. |
