| [PointCloudInstance Class](d17686cb-b8c5-bee5-44d3-0311d27678e0.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Extracts a collection of points based on a filter.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public PointCollection GetPoints( 	PointCloudFilter filter, 	double averageDistance, 	int numPoints ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetPoints ( _ 	filter As PointCloudFilter, _ 	averageDistance As Double, _ 	numPoints As Integer _ ) As PointCollection ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: PointCollection^ GetPoints( 	PointCloudFilter^ filter,  	double averageDistance,  	int numPoints ) ``` |

#### Parameters

filter
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.PointClouds PointCloudFilter](ca6f916b-2eba-f8e5-8939-1c063330c886.htm)    
     The filter to control which points are extracted. The filter should be passed in the coordinates of the Revit model.

averageDistance
:   Type:  System Double    
     Desired average distance between "adjacent" cloud points (Revit units of length). The smaller the averageDistance the larger number of points will be returned up to the numPoints limit. Specifying this parameter makes actual number of points returned for a given filter independent of the density of coverage produced by the scanner.

numPoints
:   Type:  System Int32    
     The maximum number of points requested.

#### Return Value

A collection object containing points that pass the filter, but no more than the maximum number requested.

# Remarks

If there are more points in the cloud passing the filter than the number requested in this function, the results may not be consistent if the same call is made again.

    int totalCount = points.Count;
