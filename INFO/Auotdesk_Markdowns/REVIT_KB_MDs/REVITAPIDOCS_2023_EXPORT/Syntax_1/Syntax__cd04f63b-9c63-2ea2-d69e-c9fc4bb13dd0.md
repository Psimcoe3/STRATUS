#### Parameters

serverId
:   Type:  System Guid    
     Id of the server.

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document for which the server is being set as active.

# Remarks

Only one server per document can be set as active at any given time in a single-server service. A document does not have to have an explicitly set active server though - the application-wide active server would be normally used when the service is executed for such a document.

Having an active server for a document overrules the active server set for the application. That means if the service gets executed in this particular document, the document-specific server will be used instead of the application-wide one.

It is possible to set a server as active when another server is already active for that service in this document. Making a server active will automatically deactivate the server that was active before this call.
