     The wall in question

end
:   Type:  System Int32    
     0 or 1 for the beginning or end of the wall's curve

# Remarks

By default all walls are allowed to join at ends, so this function is only needed if this wall end is already disallowed to join. If this wall is a stacked wall, all subwalls at this end will be allowed to join.
