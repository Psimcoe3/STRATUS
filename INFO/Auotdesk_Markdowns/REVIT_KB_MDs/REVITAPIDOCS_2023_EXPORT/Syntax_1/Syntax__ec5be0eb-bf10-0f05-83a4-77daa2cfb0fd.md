PartMaker is an element which takes some source elements (e.g., a wall with all its layers) and creates one or more Parts out of it. The logic according to which these Parts are created is non-trivial and PartMaker uses various PartMakerMethods which represents these logics. This element manages the strategy to make Part elements for one or more original elements.
