| [CurveElement Class](61673852-2d08-003d-e9fd-4be89d533774.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Returns the state of a tangent join between this and another curve element at the given end-point.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2017

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool GetTangentLock( 	int end, 	ElementId other ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetTangentLock ( _ 	end As Integer, _ 	other As ElementId _ ) As Boolean ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: bool GetTangentLock( 	int end,  	ElementId^ other ) ``` |

#### Parameters

end
:   Type:  System Int32    
     Index of one of the curve's end. Values '0' and '1' indicate the start or end point, respectively.

other
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     ElementId of another Curve Element from the same document.

#### Return Value

Returns True if this curve element has a tangent joint with the other input element and the join is curently locked; returns False otherwise.

# Remarks

The return value indicates whether there is such tangent join and if it is currently locked. A negative value indicates that there either is no tangent join with the other element at the given end-point, or the join between those two curve element is not currently locked.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The given Id does not represent any of the two end-points of a curve element. A valid value of either '0' or '1' is expected. -or- The given ElementId (%elementId) is not of a valid Curve Element. A valid Curve Element must be in the same document and must be diferent than this curve elements self. -or- This element has no tangent join with the input element at the given end-point. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was null |
