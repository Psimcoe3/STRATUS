# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public IList<CurveLoop> GetEdgesAsCurveLoops() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetEdgesAsCurveLoops As IList(Of CurveLoop) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: IList<CurveLoop^>^ GetEdgesAsCurveLoops() ``` |

#### Return Value

A list of closed curve loops, that correspond edges of face.

# Remarks

Orientations of the curves and curve loops match the orientations of the face's edges and edge loops. The order of the CurveLoops should be considered as arbitrary.
