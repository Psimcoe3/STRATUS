**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public ICollection<ElementId> Delete( 	ElementId elementId ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Delete ( _ 	elementId As ElementId _ ) As ICollection(Of ElementId) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: ICollection<ElementId^>^ Delete( 	ElementId^ elementId ) ``` |

#### Parameters

elementId
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementId](44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm)    
     Id of the element to delete.

#### Return Value

The deleted element id set.

# Remarks

This method will delete the element and any elements that are totally dependent upon that element. Any references to the deleted elements will become invalid and hence cause an exception to be thrown if they are accessed. The elements will be deleted with no prompts for user confirmation. Pinned elements will be deleted with no warnings.

Note: in a family document, the predefined elements (those elements inherited from its family template file) can't be deleted by this method.
