# Remarks

The ScheduleFilter class represents a single filter in a schedule. A filter is a condition that must be satisfied for an element to appear in the schedule. All filters must be satisfied for an element to appear in the schedule.

A schedule can be filtered by data that is not displayed in the schedule by marking the field used for filtering as hidden using the ScheduleField.IsHidden property.
