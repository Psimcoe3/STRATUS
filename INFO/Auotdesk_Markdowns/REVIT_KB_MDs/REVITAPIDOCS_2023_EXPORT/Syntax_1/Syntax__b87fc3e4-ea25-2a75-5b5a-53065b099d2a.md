| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Project ( _ 	point As XYZ _ ) As IntersectionResult ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: IntersectionResult^ Project( 	XYZ^ point ) ``` |

#### Parameters

point
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)

Geometric information if projection is successful.

# Remarks

The following is the meaning of every IntersectionResult's members:

* XYZPoint is the nearest point on the curve;
* Parameter is the unnormalized parameter on the curve (use ComputeNormalizedParameter to compute the normalized value)
* Distance is the distance from the point to the curve (equivalent to Distance).
