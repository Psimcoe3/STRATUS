# Syntax

| C# |

| ``` public bool IsDrivenByDimension { get; } ``` |

| Visual C++ |

# Remarks

Only reporting parameters can be driven by dimensions. Thus, to drive a parameter by a dimension, the parameter must first be set as reporting before it is used to label the driving dimension.

Note that the value of this property is always the opposite of the  [IsDrivenByFormula](ee9c7baa-47b9-f84d-c2e2-103711fbb756.htm)  property. It is so because a parameter of which value is evaluated by a formula cannot be driven by a dimension, and vice versa.
