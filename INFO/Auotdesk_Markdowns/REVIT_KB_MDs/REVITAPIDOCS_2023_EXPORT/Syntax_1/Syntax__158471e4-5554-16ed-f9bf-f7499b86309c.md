| [TransactionGroup Class](f1113d30-4c36-7844-1537-aad7f095cea0.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Assimilates all inner transactions by merging them into a single undo item.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2011

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public TransactionStatus Assimilate() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function Assimilate As TransactionStatus ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: TransactionStatus Assimilate() ``` |

#### Return Value

If finished successfully, this method returns TransactionStatus.Committed.

# Remarks

After a successful assimilation the transaction group is committed.

All transactions committed inside this group will be merged into one single transaction. The resulting undo item will bear this group's name.

Assimilate can be called only when all inner transaction groups and transactions are finished, i.e. after they were either committed or rolled back.

          // For our compound operation to be considered successful, both the individual
          // transactions must succeed. If either one fails, we will roll our group back,
          // regardless of what transactions might have already been committed.

          {

             // transaction together and will assign the grid's name to the one resulting transaction,
             // which will become the only item from this compound operation appearing in the undo menu.
             transGroup.Assimilate();

             // operation, we are going to roll the entire group back, which will
