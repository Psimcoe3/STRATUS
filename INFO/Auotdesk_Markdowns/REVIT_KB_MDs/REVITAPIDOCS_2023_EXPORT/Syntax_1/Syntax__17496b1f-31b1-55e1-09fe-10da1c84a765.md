# Remarks

Air Changes per hour is "unitless". It is a number. It is the number of times the air (the volume) interchanges in the room in one hour. This number is a format for expressing the requirement for airflow. The "flow" requirement for a room might be expressed, e.g., one room of 100 CF, and 3 Air Changes per Hour (ACH), would compute to 100 CF x 3 ACH / 60 min = 5 CFM.
