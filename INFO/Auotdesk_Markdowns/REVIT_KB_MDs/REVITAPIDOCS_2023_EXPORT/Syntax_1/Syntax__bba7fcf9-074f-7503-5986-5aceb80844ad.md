# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public ICollection<ElementId> GetJoinedMassEnergyAnalyticalModelElementIds() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetJoinedMassEnergyAnalyticalModelElementIds As ICollection(Of ElementId) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: ICollection<ElementId^>^ GetJoinedMassEnergyAnalyticalModelElementIds() ``` |

#### Return Value

ElementIds of other MassEnergyAnalyticalModels that are joined to this one.

# Remarks

Joined MassEnergyAnalyticalModels are created off of mass instances that are joined and which both have MassLevelData's associated. Only MassEnergyAnalyticalModels which are joined will take each other into account when regenerating surface subcategories for their Faces. For example, if two MassEnergyAnalyticalModels were adjacent but not joined, both their touching faces would be treated as "Mass Exterior Wall", instead of "Mass Interior Wall". This situation (touching things not being joined) because mass instances, and as a result, corresponding MassEnergyAnalyticalModel's are automatically joined and only become unjoined if the user unjoins them.
