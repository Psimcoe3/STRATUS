#### Parameters

failure
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FailureMessageAccessor](753477d8-b720-97a0-26f5-439d49de418c.htm)    
     The failure.

#### Return Value

The list of the types of failure resolutions attempted for the failure.

# Remarks

In some cases attempt to resolve a failure has no impact or failure gets reposted during next round of the end of transaction checks after being resolved. Knowing if any failure resolutions were attempted for the failure allows failures processor to prevent infinite loop.
