| [Curve Class](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Returns the vectors describing the curve at the specified parameter.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public Transform ComputeDerivatives( 	double parameter, 	bool normalized ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function ComputeDerivatives ( _ 	parameter As Double, _ 	normalized As Boolean _ ) As Transform ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: Transform^ ComputeDerivatives( 	double parameter,  	bool normalized ) ``` |

#### Parameters

parameter
:   Type:  [System Double](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/643eft0t)    
     The parameter to be evaluated.

normalized
:   Type:  [System Boolean](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a28wyd50)    
     If false, param is interpreted as natural parameterization of the curve. If true, param is expected to be in [0,1] interval mapped to the bounds of the curve. Setting to true is valid only if the curve is bound.

#### Return Value

The transformation containing the point on the curve, the tangent vector, derivative of tangent vector, and bi-normal vector.

# Remarks

The following is the meaning of the transformation members: Origin is the point on the curve (equivalent to  [Evaluate(Double, Boolean)](1145f18e-3e01-60df-e438-e176c38c3ce9.htm)  ).BasisX is the tangent vector (the first derivative).BasisY is the second derivative. Note that for curves where this cannot be uniquely determined (e.g. lines), this will be a Zero vector.BasisZ is the bi-normal vector (tangent x normal). Note that for curves where normal cannot be uniquely determined (e.g. lines), this will be a Zero vector. None of the vectors are normalized.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The given value for parameter is not finite |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentOutOfRangeException](60f148c9-ece0-a6bb-4e12-bb4a9c8c8a24.htm) | The curve cannot be evaluated as normalized because it is unbound. -or- The parameter is not a valid value for normalized evaluation. |
