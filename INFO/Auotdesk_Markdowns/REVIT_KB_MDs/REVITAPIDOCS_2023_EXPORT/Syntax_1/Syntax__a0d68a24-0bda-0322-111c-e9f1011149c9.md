| [NurbSpline Class](65c43ffe-3972-ae2b-4aa4-e2901cdbb3a8.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Creates a new geometric Curve object from NURBS curve data, which includes weights. The created curve may be a NURBSpline or a simpler curve such as line or arc.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 17.0.0.0 (17.0.1090.0)   
  **Since:**  2017

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static Curve CreateCurve( 	int degree, 	IList<double> knots, 	IList<XYZ> controlPoints, 	IList<double> weights ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function CreateCurve ( _ 	degree As Integer, _ 	knots As IList(Of Double), _ 	controlPoints As IList(Of XYZ), _ 	weights As IList(Of Double) _ ) As Curve ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static Curve^ CreateCurve( 	int degree,  	IList<double>^ knots,  	IList<XYZ^>^ controlPoints,  	IList<double>^ weights ) ``` |

#### Parameters

degree
:   Type:  [System Int32](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/td2s409d)    
     The degree of the NURBSpline.

knots
:   Type:  [System.Collections.Generic IList](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5y536ey6)   [Double](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/643eft0t)    
     The knots of the NURBSpline.

controlPoints
:   Type:  [System.Collections.Generic IList](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5y536ey6)   [XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The control points of the NURBSpline.

weights
:   Type:  [System.Collections.Generic IList](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5y536ey6)   [Double](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/643eft0t)    
     The weights of the NURBSpline.

#### Return Value

The new Curve object.

# Remarks

Degree must be 1 or greater. The number of control points must be greater than degree. The number of knots must equal the sum of degree, number of controlPoints and 1. The distinct knot values (ignoring multiplicities) must be in increasing order. The first degree+1 knots should be identical, as should the last degree+1 knots. The multiplicities of other (interior) knots should be less than degree -1. The number of weights must be equal to the the number of control points. The values of all weights must be positive.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | The degree must be at least 1. -or- The number of control points must be greater than degree. -or- The number of knots must equal the sum of number of control points, degree and 1. -or- An interior knot must not repeat itself more than degree times. -or- The number of weights must be the same as the number of control points and all weights must be positive. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was NULL |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentsInconsistentException](05972c68-fa6d-3a83-d720-ad84fbc4780f.htm) | Curve length is too small for Revit's tolerance (as identified by Application.ShortCurveTolerance). |
