# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool KeepRotatedTextReadable { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property KeepRotatedTextReadable As Boolean 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property bool KeepRotatedTextReadable { 	bool get (); 	void set (bool value); } ``` |

# Remarks

If the property is True then the text inside the text box gets oriented so it is readable when looking straight up at the sheet or from its right side; in other words, the text would never be upside down.

If the value is False, however, the text's orientation strictly follows the rotation of the text box, which means the text may be upside down when viewed on screen or printed on a sheet.
