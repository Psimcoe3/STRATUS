For a floor plan view, calculates the paths from each start point to its closest destination and return the path end points.

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static IList<XYZ> FindEndsOfShortestPaths( 	View DBView, 	IList<XYZ> destinationPoints, 	IList<XYZ> startPoints ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function FindEndsOfShortestPaths ( _ 	DBView As View, _ 	destinationPoints As IList(Of XYZ), _ 	startPoints As IList(Of XYZ) _ ) As IList(Of XYZ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static IList<XYZ^>^ FindEndsOfShortestPaths( 	View^ DBView,  	IList<XYZ^>^ destinationPoints,  	IList<XYZ^>^ startPoints ) ``` |

#### Parameters

DBView
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.htm)    
     The floor plan view to use when computing the points.

destinationPoints
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     Destination points. The input Z coordinates are ignored and set to the view's level elevation.

startPoints
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     Start points for which shortest path end points are calculated.

#### Return Value

End points of paths calculated from each start point to its corresponding closest destination. If a path cannot be calculated the corresponsing end point is set to the corresponding start point.

# Remarks

The calculation is done in a floor plan with one or more destinationPoints and one or more startPoints. The shortest path is calculated from each start point to its corresponding closest destination.

# Exceptions
