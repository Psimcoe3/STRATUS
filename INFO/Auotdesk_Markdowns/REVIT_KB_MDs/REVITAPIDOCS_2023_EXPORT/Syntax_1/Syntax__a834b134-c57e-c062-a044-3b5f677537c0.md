document

     The document containing the family to be converted.

     The family id.

# Remarks

Converts a family hosted by some element other than a face to be hosted by a face. This is done by replacing the existing host (wall, roof, ceiling, floor) with a face. Conversion can succeed only if FamilyUtils.FamilyCanConvertToFaceHostBased() returns true.
