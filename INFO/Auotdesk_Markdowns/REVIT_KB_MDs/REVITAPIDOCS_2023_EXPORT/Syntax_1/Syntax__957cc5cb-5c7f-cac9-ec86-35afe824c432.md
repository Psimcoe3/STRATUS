     The other collector

#### Return Value

A handle to this collector. This is the same collector that has just been modified, returned so you can chain multiple calls together in one line.

The result will be the same as using a LogicalOrFilter to connect this filter with another. If you have an active iterator to this collector it will be stopped by this call.
