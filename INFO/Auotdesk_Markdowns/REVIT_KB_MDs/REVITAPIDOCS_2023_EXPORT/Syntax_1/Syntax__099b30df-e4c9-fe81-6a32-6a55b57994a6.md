Changes the elevation value for points

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture](720f0c58-cb2b-4f13-374a-7348ed0a1cd3.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 22.0.0.0 (22.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2014

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void ChangePointsElevation( 	IList<XYZ> points, 	double elevationValue ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub ChangePointsElevation ( _ 	points As IList(Of XYZ), _ 	elevationValue As Double _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void ChangePointsElevation( 	IList<XYZ^>^ points,  	double elevationValue ) ``` |

#### Parameters

points
:   Type:  System.Collections.Generic IList   [XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The points to be modified.

elevationValue
:   Type:  System Double    
     The new elevation value.

# Remarks

If none of the points in the collection doesn's exist, an exception will be thrown. This function ignores input points that do not exist, unless all of the input points do not exist, which will result in an exception. This applies to a TopographySurface element (not a SiteSubRegion or a topography surface associated with a BuildingPad), which shoule be in an active TopographyEditScope.
