# Remarks

This affects only if the category is set visible or invisible individually. Other Revit mechanisms may also affect the visibility of elements of this category, including:

* the category classes settings for model categories, annotation categories, import categories or analytical model categories.
* view filters

Thus setting this value may not affect the actual visibility of elements of this category in the view.
