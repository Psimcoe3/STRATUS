An element that represents a custom family (not a system family) in Autodesk Revit.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class Family : Element ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class Family _ 	Inherits Element ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class Family : public Element ``` |

# Remarks

Custom families within the Revit API represented by three objects - Family,  [FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.htm)  and  [FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.htm)  . Each object plays a significant part in the structure of families. The Family element represents the entire family that consists of a collection of types, such as an 'I Beam'. You can think of that object as representing the entire family file. The Family object contains a number of  [FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.htm)  elements. The  [FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.htm)  object represents a specific set of family settings within that Family and represents what is known in the Revit user interface as a Type, such as 'W14x32'. The  [FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.htm)  object represents an actual instance of that type placed the Autodesk Revit project. For example the  [FamilyInstance](0d2231f8-91e6-794f-92ae-16aad8014b27.htm)  would be a single instance of a W14x32 column within the project.
