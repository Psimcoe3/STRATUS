#### Parameters

elementType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB ElementType](ffb18296-0448-559c-580c-7857cbcdc094.htm)    
     The ElementType of which instances are to be placed.

# Remarks

This method works only for non-annotation element types. For annotations, use PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement(Autodesk::Revit::DB::FamilySymbol) instead. This method uses its own transaction, so it's not permitted to be invoked in an active transaction. The user is not permitted to change the active legend view or during this placement operation (the operation will be cancelled). In a single invocation, the user can place multiple instances of the input element type until they finish the placement (with Cancel or ESC or a click elsewhere in the UI).
