| [BooleanOperationsUtils Class](a7be98f3-9e8a-ee51-f46c-2479cb72c598.htm)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Perform a boolean geometric operation between two solids, and modify the original solid to represent the result.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 16.0.0.0 (16.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2012

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static void ExecuteBooleanOperationModifyingOriginalSolid( 	Solid solid0, 	Solid solid1, 	BooleanOperationsType booleanType ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Sub ExecuteBooleanOperationModifyingOriginalSolid ( _ 	solid0 As Solid, _ 	solid1 As Solid, _ 	booleanType As BooleanOperationsType _ ) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static void ExecuteBooleanOperationModifyingOriginalSolid( 	Solid^ solid0,  	Solid^ solid1,  	BooleanOperationsType booleanType ) ``` |

#### Parameters

solid0
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Solid](7a3b5ac1-c66d-9f81-a11d-9bcd4e026295.htm)    
     The original solid object. This object cannot be obtained directly from a Revit element. This means that  [IsElementGeometry](be3ad18d-a9d3-25ed-6200-4f71d3cd4754.htm)  cannot be true.

solid1
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Solid](7a3b5ac1-c66d-9f81-a11d-9bcd4e026295.htm)    
     The second solid object. A copy will be taken of the input object, so any solid whether obtained from a Revit element or not would be accepted.

booleanType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB BooleanOperationsType](46aeb9cd-4b44-0dcf-6f78-469c1271f5d4.htm)    
     boolean operation type.

# Remarks

This operation modifies the original input Geometry objects.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentException](2e6e4206-97a8-dd4b-df5d-4269f4bb6088.htm) | Thrown when the original solid object is the geometry of the Revit model. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions ArgumentNullException](631e1424-60f4-929b-4e52-dda9dcd26316.htm) | A non-optional argument was NULL |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | Failed to perform the Boolean operation for the two solids. This may be due to geometric inaccuracies in the solids, such as slightly misaligned faces or edges. If so, eliminating the inaccuracies by making sure the solids are accurately aligned may solve the problem. This also may be due to one or both solids having complexities such as more than two faces geometrically meeting along a single edge, or two coincident edges, etc. Eliminating such conditions, or performing a sequence of Boolean operations in an order that avoids such conditions, may solve the problem." |
