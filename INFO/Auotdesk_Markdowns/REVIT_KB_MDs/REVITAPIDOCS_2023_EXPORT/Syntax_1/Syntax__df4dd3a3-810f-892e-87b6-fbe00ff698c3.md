Returns a 3D curve lying in the XY plane in XYZ coordinates, representing the 2D curve with its UV coordinates identified with XY coordinates.

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public Curve As3DCurveInXYPlane() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function As3DCurveInXYPlane As Curve ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |

| ``` public: Curve^ As3DCurveInXYPlane() ``` |

#### Return Value

3D curve lying in the XY plane in XYZ coordinates, representing the 2D curve with its UV coordinates identified with XY coordinates.

# Remarks

Ideally, this function should only be used in cases when the 2D curve needs to be used in a context that does not support 2D curves, but can represent them as 3D curves with Z = 0 everywhere (for example, converting the 2D curve to another CAD system that does not support 2D curves).
