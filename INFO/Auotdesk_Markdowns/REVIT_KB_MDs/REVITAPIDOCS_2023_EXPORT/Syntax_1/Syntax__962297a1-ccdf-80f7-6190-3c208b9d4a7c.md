     A document.

reference

     The reference that is part of the element that will be checked.

#### Return Value

True if the input Element can host reinforcement elements, false otherwise.

# Remarks

Many different elements are allowed to host reinforcement, for example, beams, walls, columns, or parts. Often there are specific restrictions about whether an element can host rebar beyond its type or category. For example, the material type of the element may determine this. Or for parts, the part must have been created from layers that have their role set to Structure.
