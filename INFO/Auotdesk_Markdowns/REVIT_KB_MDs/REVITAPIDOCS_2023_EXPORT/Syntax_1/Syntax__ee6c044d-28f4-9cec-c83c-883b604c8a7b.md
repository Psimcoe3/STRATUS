# Syntax

| C# |

| ``` public void ResolveFailure( 	FailureMessageAccessor failure ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub ResolveFailure ( _ 	failure As FailureMessageAccessor _ ) ``` |

#### Parameters

failure
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FailureMessageAccessor](753477d8-b720-97a0-26f5-439d49de418c.htm)    
     The accessor to the failure to be resolved.

# Remarks

If failure resolution type was not set, the default failure resolution type will be used. After execution of the failure resolution the failure will not be removed from the document automatically. To prevent the failure from being delivered to the user, failures (pre)processor should return ProceedWithCommit. It will cause failures to be regenerated and failure resolution process to be restarted. If attempt to resolve failure was not successful, and the same failure is present on repetitive calls of the failures (pre)processor, the preprocessor code should take care to attempt a different resolution the next time the failure appears, to avoid an infinite loop.
