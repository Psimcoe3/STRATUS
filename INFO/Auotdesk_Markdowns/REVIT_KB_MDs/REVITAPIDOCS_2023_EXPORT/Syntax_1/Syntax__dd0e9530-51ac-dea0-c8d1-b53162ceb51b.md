# Remarks

Retrieved description text for built-in Revit failures is localized. The result may vary from the description text retrieved from the corresponding FailureMessage. A failure definition contains a description string, that may have format specifiers like %s, and "sample" strings, that will be used to resolve them. A FailureMessage will contain "specific" strings. So, in the failure definition description "Cannot keep %s joined" will be converted into "Cannot keep Element joined" while the description in actual FailureMessage will read "Cannot keep Walls joined" or "Cannot keep Beams joined"
