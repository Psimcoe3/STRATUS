Creates a new path of travel between two points and provides creation result status.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Analysis](958e2e12-587d-f188-5d7b-f13d7dbfdf48.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 23.0.0.0 (23.1.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2020

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public static PathOfTravel Create( 	View DBView, 	XYZ pathStart, 	XYZ pathEnd, 	out PathOfTravelCalculationStatus resultStatus ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Shared Function Create ( _ 	DBView As View, _ 	pathStart As XYZ, _ 	pathEnd As XYZ, _ 	<OutAttribute> ByRef resultStatus As PathOfTravelCalculationStatus _ ) As PathOfTravel ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: static PathOfTravel^ Create( 	View^ DBView,  	XYZ^ pathStart,  	XYZ^ pathEnd,  	[OutAttribute] PathOfTravelCalculationStatus% resultStatus ) ``` |

#### Parameters

DBView
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB View](fb92a4e7-f3a7-ef14-e631-342179b18de9.htm)    
     The floor plan view to use when computing the shortest distance.

pathStart
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The start point of the path. The input Z coordinates are ignored and set to the view's level elevation.

pathEnd
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB XYZ](c2fd995c-95c0-58fb-f5de-f3246cbc5600.htm)    
     The end point of the path. The input Z coordinates are ignored and set to the view's level elevation.

resultStatus
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Analysis PathOfTravelCalculationStatus](c87dc425-1e13-40b9-df6d-08fde112210b.htm)   %    
     Result status of path of travel creation.

#### Return Value

The newly created path of travel element, or    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  if no path between the two points is found.

# Remarks

InvalidOperationException is thrown if PathOfTravel cannot be created for the following conditions:

* View has crop box active and crop box is split
* View has crop box active and start or end point lies outside of the crop
* View model outline area is larger than the current limit (2,000,000 sq.ft.)
* View export contains too much geometry (more than 200,000 lines)
* Start and end points are too close
