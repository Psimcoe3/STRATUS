The sketch plane assigned to the view for model curve creation.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public SketchPlane SketchPlane { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property SketchPlane As SketchPlane 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property SketchPlane^ SketchPlane { 	SketchPlane^ get (); 	void set (SketchPlane^ value); } ``` |

#### Field Value

The sketch plane, or    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  for views which don't allow sketching (such as schedules) or for views that allow model curve creation but have no current sketch plane assigned.

# Remarks

If this property is set in when the current work plane is visible, the updated work plane will not be shown until the current transaction is committed. Therefore it is recommended the Add-On commits the transaction before performing UI operations (for example, PickPoint).
