# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class StructuralInstanceUsageFilter : ElementSlowFilter ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class StructuralInstanceUsageFilter _ 	Inherits ElementSlowFilter ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class StructuralInstanceUsageFilter : public ElementSlowFilter ``` |

# Remarks

This filter is a slow filter, but it uses a quick filter to eliminate non-candidate elements before the elements are obtained and expanded. Therefore this filter does not have to be paired with another quick filter to minimize the number of Elements that are expanded.
