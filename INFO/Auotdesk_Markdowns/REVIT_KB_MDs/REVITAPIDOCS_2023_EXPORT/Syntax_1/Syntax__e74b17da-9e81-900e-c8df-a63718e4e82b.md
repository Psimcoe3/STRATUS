# Remarks

This method, if successful, changes the active document. The model will override the local change with the latest change if it is a cloud model and it was restored, or relinquished, or out of date. It is not allowed to have an open transaction in the active document when calling this method. Consequently, this method can only be used in manual transaction mode, not in automatic mode. Additionally, this method may not be called from inside an event handler.
