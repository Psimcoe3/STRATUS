Updates the elements in the Revit document to reflect all changes.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public void Regenerate() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Sub Regenerate ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: void Regenerate() ``` |

# Remarks

Use this method to force update to the document after a group of changes. Note that when a transaction is committed there is an automatic call to regenerate the document.

# Examples

```
FamilyInstance instance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(new XYZ(15, 20, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural);
FamilyInstance instance2 = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(new XYZ(25, 30, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural);
// faster to create multiple instances without calling Regenerate after each one

LocationPoint point = instance.Location as LocationPoint;
// this data is incorrect because the new geometry has not yet been regenerated

doc.Regenerate();
point = instance.Location as LocationPoint;
// now it is correct
```

 

![](https://d24b2zsrnzhmgb.cloudfront.net/static/img/chm/icons/CopyCode.gif) Copy  VB.NET

```
Dim instance As FamilyInstance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(New XYZ(15, 20, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural)
Dim instance2 As FamilyInstance = doc.Create.NewFamilyInstance(New XYZ(25, 30, 0), familySymbol, StructuralType.NonStructural)
' faster to create multiple instances without calling Regenerate after each one


Dim point As LocationPoint = TryCast(instance.Location, LocationPoint)
' this data is incorrect because the new geometry has not yet been regenerated


doc.Regenerate()
point = TryCast(instance.Location, LocationPoint)
' now it is correct
```

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions RegenerationFailedException](787bb389-74c2-5ce7-cdd6-32211209ded2.htm) | Thrown when the operation fails.  * If regeneration fails, there is posted error of severity DocumentCorruption that will be delivered to the end user at the end of transaction explaining what specifically has happened. * If regeneration has failed, document is corrupted and even reading from it is illegal. * Code that called regeneration and got this exception should not catch and ignore it - instead, it should do nothing but internal cleanup and return control to the owner of currently active transaction/subtransaction, which must be aborted. |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | Modification of the document is forbidden. Typically, this is because there is no open transaction; consult documentation for Document.IsModified for other possible causes. |
