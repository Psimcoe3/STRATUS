# Remarks

Execution of a DirectContext3D server means that the server is called upon to contribute a bounding box and graphics content (opaque and transparent) for an opened view. The following are some of the conditions that control whether the server is executed:

1. The return value of this interface method.
2. Whether the server is one of the active servers for the service.
3. For servers that use DirectContext3D handles, the visibility of handle instances.
