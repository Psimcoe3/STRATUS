| [Document Class](ab1718f9-45fb-b3d3-827e-32ff81cf929c.htm)   [Example](#exampleToggle)   [See Also](#seeAlsoToggle) |

Inserts a new instance of a family into the document, using a curve, type/symbol and reference level.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.Creation](ded320da-058a-4edd-0418-0582389559a7.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 16.0.0.0 (16.0.0.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public FamilyInstance NewFamilyInstance( 	Curve curve, 	FamilySymbol symbol, 	Level level, 	StructuralType structuralType ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function NewFamilyInstance ( _ 	curve As Curve, _ 	symbol As FamilySymbol, _ 	level As Level, _ 	structuralType As StructuralType _ ) As FamilyInstance ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: FamilyInstance^ NewFamilyInstance( 	Curve^ curve,  	FamilySymbol^ symbol,  	Level^ level,  	StructuralType structuralType ) ``` |

#### Parameters

curve
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Curve](400cc9b6-9ff7-de85-6fd8-c20002209d25.htm)    
     The curve where the instance is based.

symbol
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.htm)    
     A FamilySymbol object that represents the type of the instance that is to be inserted.

level
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Level](577e5d4e-a558-118c-9dea-3b810b061775.htm)    
     A Level object that is used as the base level for the object.

structuralType
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure StructuralType](0a0a3793-5fce-283d-4953-a137f5593db9.htm)    
     If structural then specify the type of the component.

#### Return Value

If creation was successful then an instance to the new object is returned, otherwise    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  .

# Remarks

This method is used to insert one family instance into another element along the geometry of a curve. If the instance fails to be created an exception may be thrown.

The type/symbol that is used must be loaded into the document before this method is called. Families and their symbols can be loaded using the Document.LoadFamily or Document.LoadFamilySymbol methods.

The host object must be one that supports insertion of instances otherwise this method will fail. All levels within the document can be found by iterating over the entire document and searching for objects of type Autodesk.Revit.Elements.Level.

Note: if the created family instance includes nested instances, the API framework will automatically regenerate the document during this method call.

```
FamilyInstance CreateBeam(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document document, View view)
{

   // get the given view's level for beam creation
    Level level = document.GetElement(view.LevelId) as Level;

    // get a family symbol
    FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(document);
    collector.OfClass(typeof(FamilySymbol)).OfCategory(BuiltInCategory.OST_StructuralFraming);

    FamilySymbol gotSymbol = collector.FirstElement() as FamilySymbol;

    // create new beam 10' long starting at origin
    XYZ startPoint = new XYZ(0, 0, 0);
    XYZ endPoint = new Autodesk.Revit.DB.XYZ(10, 0, 0);

    Autodesk.Revit.DB.Curve beamLine = Line.CreateBound(startPoint, endPoint);

    // create a new beam
    FamilyInstance instance = document.Create.NewFamilyInstance(beamLine, gotSymbol,
                                                                level, StructuralType.Beam);

    return instance;
}
```

    Dim instance As FamilyInstance = document.Create.NewFamilyInstance(beamLine, gotSymbol, level, StructuralType.Beam)

    Return instance
End Function
