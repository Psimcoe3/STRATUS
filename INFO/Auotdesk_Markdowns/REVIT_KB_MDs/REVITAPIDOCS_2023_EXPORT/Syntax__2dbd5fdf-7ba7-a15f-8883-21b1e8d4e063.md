# Remarks

Execution of a service should be invoked only by the application that registered the service. The execution will use the given server.

The serverId must be of a valid server that is currently registered for the service, ArgumentException be thrown if it is not available.

Because this method executes an explicitly specified server regardless of what other servers are currently active, it can only be invoked for a service that is not set as being recordable.

Plese also note that this method does not have any effect on active servers currently set for the service.
