# Members

| Member name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ByEntity | Category properties BYLAYER, overrides BYENTITY. Entities generated by a specific category are assigned to a layer accordingly to the layer settings. To preserve visual fidelity, overridden attributes result in entity-specific attributes |
| ByLayer | All properties BYLAYER, no overrides Forces all entities to follow visual properties as set by their layer. Visual fidelity is lost, but this produces the least number of layers while still providing by-layer control over exported entities. |
| NewLayer | All properties BYLAYER, New Layers for overrides. Visual fidelity is preserved and there is by-layer control over all entities, although number of layers in the exported file might be increased. |
