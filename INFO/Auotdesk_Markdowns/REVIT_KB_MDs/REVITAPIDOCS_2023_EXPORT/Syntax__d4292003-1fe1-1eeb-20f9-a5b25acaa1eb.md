The top elevation of the stairs run.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture](720f0c58-cb2b-4f13-374a-7348ed0a1cd3.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2013

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double TopElevation { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property TopElevation As Double 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property double TopElevation { 	double get (); 	void set (double value); } ``` |

# Remarks

The top elevation has following restrictions:

* The top elevation is relative to the base elevation of the stairs to which the stairs run belongs.
* When setting this property the value will be rounded automatically to a multiple of the riser height.
* When setting this property for common run, the run's height will change according to the new base/top elevation. So the value must be greater than base elevation to keep run valid.
* When setting this property for sketched run, whose height is fixed, the run's base elevation will be adjusted to keep the same run height.
