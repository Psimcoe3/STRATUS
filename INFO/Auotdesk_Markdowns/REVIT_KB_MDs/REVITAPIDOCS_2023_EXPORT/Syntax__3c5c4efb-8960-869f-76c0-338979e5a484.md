When called the first time, returns geometrical objects which were built. Later calls will throw exceptions.

  **Since:**  2015

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public IList<GeometryObject> GetGeometricalObjects() ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function GetGeometricalObjects As IList(Of GeometryObject) ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: IList<GeometryObject^>^ GetGeometricalObjects() ``` |

#### Return Value

Geometrical object which were built.

# Remarks

Normally an array contains a single geometrical object corresponding to either 'target' or 'fallback' type', but if multiple face sets are being built with target/fallback of "AnyGeometry/Mesh", then a two-element array with both geometry as the 1st element and mesh as the 2nd can be returned. It happens if some of the face sets require a fallback processing and some do not.
