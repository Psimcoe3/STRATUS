Returns the first partial derivatives of the underlying surface at the specified point.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 17.0.0.0 (17.0.1090.0)

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public Transform ComputeDerivatives( 	UV point ) ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Function ComputeDerivatives ( _ 	point As UV _ ) As Transform ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: Transform^ ComputeDerivatives( 	UV^ point ) ``` |

#### Parameters

point
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB UV](1724be37-059b-91ff-aa74-d1508082f76d.htm)    
     The parameters to be evaluated, in natural parameterization of the face.

#### Return Value

A transformation containing tangent vectors and a normal vector.

# Remarks

The following is the meaning of the transformation members:

* Origin is the point on the face (equivalent to  [Evaluate(UV)](d1219dd7-fc7a-6b12-afce-963d554e947d.htm)  );
* BasisX is the tangent vector along the U coordinate (partial derivative with respect to U).
* BasisY is the tangent vector along the V coordinate (partial derivative with respect to V).
* BasisZ is the underlying surface's normal vector. This is not necessarily aligned with the normal vector pointing out of a solid that contains the face, to get that value use  [ComputeNormal(UV)](15377d5b-d369-2e09-98ef-ca0eb0af86a1.htm)  .

None of the vectors are normalized.
