# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public bool IsComponentFlipped { get; set; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Property IsComponentFlipped As Boolean 	Get 	Set ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property bool IsComponentFlipped { 	bool get (); 	void set (bool value); } ``` |

# Remarks

This property has no effect unless a pattern is selected (the ObjectType property is not    a null reference (  Nothing  in Visual Basic)  ). Changing this flag effectively reflects the component through its XY-plane, which is equivalent to reflecting it through the original surface.
