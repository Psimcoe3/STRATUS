A constraint that measures the length of a segment as measured by projecting onto a direction that is not parallel to the segment.

  **Since:**  2012

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class RebarShapeConstraintProjectedSegmentLength : RebarShapeConstraint ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class RebarShapeConstraintProjectedSegmentLength _ 	Inherits RebarShapeConstraint ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class RebarShapeConstraintProjectedSegmentLength : public RebarShapeConstraint ``` |

# Remarks

The constraint has two references, indexed by 0 and 1, that do not have to correspond to the start and end of the segment. The constraint also specifies a direction as a 2D vector, which is not necessarily parallel to the segment, but must point from the segment's start toward its end.
