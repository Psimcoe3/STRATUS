| Public property Static member | [InvalidWorkplaneForStructuralFraming](09068ede-0610-41c7-bc37-e71be67c6bc3.htm) | Workplane not valid for Structural Framing component "[Family Name]" |

| Public property Static member | [TrussChordUntransformable](cdfd61d2-1a2f-72e5-b742-fa5909dbdae1.htm) | Unable to maintain user changes to unpinned Chord. Restoring Truss-defined shape. |
| Public property Static member | [TrussDuplicateEngineeringType](9f59960a-bf96-8e42-fdbb-362728f61208.htm) | Elements have duplicate 'Engineering Type' values. |
| Public property Static member | [TrussInvalidSymbolGeom](6f785510-5d44-5efc-f093-1a5030a85daa.htm) | Truss is unable to generate any members due to layout family error. |
