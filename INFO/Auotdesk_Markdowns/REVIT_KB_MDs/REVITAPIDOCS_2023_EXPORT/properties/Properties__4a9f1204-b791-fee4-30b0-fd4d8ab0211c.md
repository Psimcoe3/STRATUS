# Properties

|  | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public property Static member | [AreaBoundaryLinesOverlap](49b8388d-a045-48d8-3cc0-899d75dfb754.htm) | Highlighted area boundary lines overlap. Color fills, area tags, and areas may not behave correctly. |
| Public property Static member | [CurvesOverlap](b82f576f-163c-d370-bed9-951193acfc07.htm) | Highlighted lines overlap. Lines may not form closed loops. |
| Public property Static member | [DivisionSketchOverlap](d294391d-151a-89ee-34eb-f0725768ff1a.htm) | Curves in the sketch of the Division overlap. |
| Public property Static member | [DuplicateFabricSheet](299e648f-5808-ee61-aa6b-468dffb5a050.htm) | There are identical Fabric sheets in the same place. This will result in double counting in schedules. |
| Public property Static member | [DuplicateInstances](2eeccaa4-2e8b-ee4f-de30-9d75d31fc4e3.htm) | There are identical instances in the same place. This will result in double counting in schedules. |
| Public property Static member | [DuplicatePoints](fcc40b7f-3740-f797-0fcb-a22bd2b98bcd.htm) | There are identical points in the same place. Lines created from points may not work as expected. |
| Public property Static member | [DuplicateRebar](c78f3400-20f1-b9d2-efb4-e4eda9765d42.htm) | There are identical rebar in the same place. This will result in double counting in schedules. |
| Public property Static member | [ELASeparationLinesOverlap](577baeef-b75f-877b-5ee1-ff2ed892d7fd.htm) | Highlighted area based load boundary lines overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds load area boundaries. Delete one of the lines. |
| Public property Static member | [FloorsOverlap](76d91468-6173-efc2-01e6-c4f76280eae2.htm) | Highlighted floors overlap. |
| Public property Static member | [LevelsOverlap](2881d7ee-e470-3f24-e219-3f5818435db7.htm) | Highlighted levels overlap. |
| Public property Static member | [OverlappingElementsTest](f4c75062-03bf-4bc8-175e-c9c92bf02bbd.htm) | There are overlapping structural framing elements of the same type in the project found by Dynamic Update. |
| Public property Static member | [RoomSeparationLinesOverlap](a63a1a21-d01c-f778-3481-a9d0901037bb.htm) | Highlighted room separation lines overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds room boundaries. Delete one of the lines. |
| Public property Static member | [SpaceSeparationLinesOverlap](072b35eb-44b7-75f3-6a41-70cca19782e7.htm) | Highlighted space separation lines overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds space boundaries. Delete one of the lines. |
| Public property Static member | [WallAreaBoundaryOverlap](9c28cfed-0568-e1a6-acf0-1ba9dbf1fc45.htm) | Wall and area boundary line overlap. Color fills, area tags and areas may not behave correctly. |
| Public property Static member | [WallRoomSeparationOverlap](ef4cbc39-8128-9e08-0704-747af60db504.htm) | A wall and a room separation line overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds room boundaries. Shorten or delete the room separation line to remove the overlap. |
| Public property Static member | [WallsOverlap](e6c930d3-51a7-4c77-b847-74250154821a.htm) | Highlighted walls overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds room boundaries. Use Cut Geometry to embed one wall within the other. |
| Public property Static member | [WallSpaceSeparationOverlap](a2eae757-96d3-9d1c-044c-439ddfb19bdd.htm) | A wall and a space separation line overlap. One of them may be ignored when Revit finds space boundaries. Shorten or delete the space separation line to remove the overlap. |
