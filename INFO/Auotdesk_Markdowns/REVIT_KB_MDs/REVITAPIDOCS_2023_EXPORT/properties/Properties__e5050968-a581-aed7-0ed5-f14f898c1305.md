| Public property Static member | [NoSpaces](303bce4e-3c69-58f3-18ef-281449324825.htm) | Revit was unable to identify any spaces. If you are sure that spaces have been created in the project, please check the Project Phase setting to verify that the Project Phase matches the phase in which spaces have been defined in your project. |
| Public property Static member | [NoSpacesWarn](626d56c9-62bc-219b-bf23-d1682c131eb4.htm) | Revit was unable to identify any spaces. If you are sure that spaces have been created in the project, please check the Project Phase setting to verify that the Project Phase matches the phase in which spaces have been defined in your project. |
| Public property Static member | [PlenumWithNoCeilingWarn](c5624f74-c0c8-e701-641d-a23636a403a7.htm) | [Room] has Space Type set to Plenum but has no ceiling surface. A plenum must be separated from the space it serves by a ceiling. |
| Public property Static member | [ProblemWithLightingLoadWarn](a58dc1ae-924a-3ccb-ecd4-d8a299eae64e.htm) | [Room]'s lighting load is too high. This may be caused by an incorrect density value and must be corrected before this space can be included in the load calculations. |
| Public property Static member | [ProblemWithPeopleLoadWarn](b31ed668-78c6-dd14-8d73-5333c9e2e1da.htm) | [Room]'s number of people or people load (sensible or latent) is too high. This may be caused by an incorrect density value and must be corrected before this space can be included in the load calculations. |
| Public property Static member | [ProblemWithPowerLoadWarn](35d139bc-2092-b845-1fa1-52e95441972d.htm) | [Room]'s power load is too high. This may be caused by an incorrect density value and must be corrected before this space can be included in the load calculations. |
| Public property Static member | [RoomGeometryCannotFindFreeFacesBoundingElement](3fe209b6-f601-f23b-9eea-fce48e299152.htm) | An error occurred while trying to find the free part of a face of the bounding geometry for [Room] when processing the room-bounding element [Name]. The free part of the face is found by subtracting the portions of the face that overlap various room-bounding element faces. |
| Public property Static member | [RoomGeometryCannotOverlapBoundingElement](ed593c79-893f-b7bf-c09d-2e598708793f.htm) | An error occurred while trying to find the region where a face of the bounding geometry for [Room] overlaps a face of a room-bounding element [Name]. |
| Public property Static member | [RoomGeometryCannotTrimBoundingElement](b593fe63-e478-3310-3a94-429645806c77.htm) | An error occurred while trimming the vertical shadow of a room-bounding element [Name] of the bounding geometry for [Room]. |
| Public property Static member | [RoomNotPlacedWarn](d6161895-da58-fa9d-b851-88c0fbf6366b.htm) | [Family] is not placed. Physical properties such as area will display as "Not Placed" in schedules. You can place the [Family] using the option bar in the [Family] tool, or you can delete the [Family] in a schedule. [Room] will be ignored in the energy analysis model. |
| Public property Static member | [RoomNotUpperBoundedByElement](7eb6d076-5860-ad25-55fb-a837d5729d7f.htm) | [Family] is not upper bounded by a roof, ceiling or floor element. This can result in incorrect adjacencies and voids in the analytical model. Please ensure that Upper Limit and Limit Offset for [Room] is set correctly. |
| Public property Static member | [RoomVolumeNegativeWarn](04cc8beb-5685-4afa-7a54-cedcda8ea642.htm) | [Room] has a negative volume? [Room] will be ignored in the energy analysis model. |
| Public property Static member | [RoomVolumeNotComputedWarn](bf1ee13a-ebb7-df63-be34-5080abb96183.htm) | [Family] volume can't be computed. The bounding geometry (in 3D) can't be found for [Room]. [Room] will be ignored in the energy analysis model. |
| Public property Static member | [SpaceResolutionOutOfRange](01abdb4e-e919-6d6e-94b9-8f66390e145c.htm) | Voxel size is out of range. |
| Public property Static member | [SurfaceResolutionOutOfRange](3f87d115-6b71-9ffa-67f6-b274d46fd0f4.htm) | Pixel size is out of range. |
| Public property Static member | [UndefinedRooms](3510176b-9396-48c3-286b-cd9398402b09.htm) | There are undefined Rooms in the model! Recommend creating a Room schedule and checking the Area parameter of each Room for warnings. |
| Public property Static member | [UndefinedSpaces](bb0635dd-ed39-feea-a060-0981d43e880d.htm) | There are undefined Spaces in the model! Recommend creating a Space schedule and checking the Area parameter of each Space for warnings. |
| Public property Static member | [ZoneWithoutSpacesWarn](102b4443-63b1-17eb-c426-e287a86982f0.htm) | This zone has no spaces. |
