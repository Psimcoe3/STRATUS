# Remarks

This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory. In some situations (for example, when the element geometry is not yet calculated for the input view) this filter may return true even though the element may not actually be visible when geometry is calculated.
