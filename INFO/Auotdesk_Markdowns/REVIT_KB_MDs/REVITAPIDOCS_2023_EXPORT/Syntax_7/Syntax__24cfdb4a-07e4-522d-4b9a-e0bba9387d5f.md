# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public class FamilySymbolFilter : ElementQuickFilter ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Class FamilySymbolFilter _ 	Inherits ElementQuickFilter ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public ref class FamilySymbolFilter : public ElementQuickFilter ``` |

# Remarks

This filter is a quick filter. Quick filters operate only on the ElementRecord, a low-memory class which has a limited interface to read element properties. Elements which are rejected by a quick filter will not be expanded in memory.

Note that it may be faster to get a list of symbol ids from  [GetFamilySymbolIds](8989a269-c516-0ace-5365-864a61df1103.htm)  rather than to iterate all of the contents of a document with this filter applied.
