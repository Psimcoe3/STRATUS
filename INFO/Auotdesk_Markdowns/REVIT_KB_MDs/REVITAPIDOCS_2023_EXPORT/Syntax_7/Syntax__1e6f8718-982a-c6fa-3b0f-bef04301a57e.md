# Remarks

(Revit uses only orientable faces and surfaces). At any point on a face or surface, the face's or surface's orientation is specified by the normal vector at that point. The face's normal vector can be the same or opposite to that of its surface. If OrientationMatchesSurfaceOrientation() is true, then the face’s normal vector is the same as that of its surface at each point on the face, otherwise the normal vectors are opposite. See also Surface::OrientationMatchesParametricOrientation.
