#### Parameters

familySymbol
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB FamilySymbol](a1acaed0-6a62-4c1d-94f5-4e27ce0923d3.htm)    
     The FamilySymbol.

# Remarks

This method opens its own transaction, so it's not permitted to be invoked in an active transaction. In a single invocation, the user can place multiple instances of the input family type until they finish the placement (with Cancel or ESC or a click elsewhere in the UI). The user will not be permitted to change the type to be placed. Users are not permitted to change the active view during this placement operation (the operation will be completed).

This method differs from  [PostRequestForElementTypePlacement(ElementType)](f9bf4ed3-0354-6bc1-6db3-e34fcbace950.htm)  in that it will execute immediately within the current API context and return to the application when the user completes or cancels the operation. However, it does not allow the user access to user interface options and settings related to the placement.

# Exceptions
