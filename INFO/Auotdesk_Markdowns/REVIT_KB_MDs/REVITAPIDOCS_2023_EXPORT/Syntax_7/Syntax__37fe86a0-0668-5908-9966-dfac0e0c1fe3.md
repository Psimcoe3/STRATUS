The base interface class for all external services.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB.ExternalService](a88f2d1d-c02f-a901-9543-44e4b5dd5fc9.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 2015.0.0.0 (2015.0.0.0)   
  **Since:**  2013

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public interface IExternalService ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public Interface IExternalService ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public interface class IExternalService ``` |

# Remarks

Both supported kinds of services - single-server and multi-server - will derive their classes from this interface, albeit indirectly through an interface specific to the particular kind. External services never derive directly from this class - they always have to derive from either ISingleServerService or IMultiServerService, respectivelly.
