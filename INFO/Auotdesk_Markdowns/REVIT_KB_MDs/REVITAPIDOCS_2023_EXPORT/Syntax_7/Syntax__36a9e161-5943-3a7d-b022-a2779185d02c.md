#### Parameters

document
:   Type:  [Autodesk.Revit.DB Document](db03274b-a107-aa32-9034-f3e0df4bb1ec.htm)    
     The document for which this transaction is going to be used.

# Remarks

The transaction does not start by creating a transaction object. One of the 'Start' methods will need to be called in order to start this transaction.

A transaction cannot start unless is has a valid (non-empty) name. Because this constructor does not take a name, a name must be assigned later before or during the 'Start' method.
