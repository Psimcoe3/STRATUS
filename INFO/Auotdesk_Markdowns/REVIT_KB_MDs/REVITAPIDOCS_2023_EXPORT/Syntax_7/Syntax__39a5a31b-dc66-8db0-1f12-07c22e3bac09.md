| Midpoint | Extend the column until its midpoint contacts the target. |
| Maximum | Extend the column until it is completely covered by the target, intersecting it if necessary. |
| Tangent | For slanted columns only. Extend the column until its driving curve contacts the target, then cut the column with a plane tangent to the target at that contact point. |
