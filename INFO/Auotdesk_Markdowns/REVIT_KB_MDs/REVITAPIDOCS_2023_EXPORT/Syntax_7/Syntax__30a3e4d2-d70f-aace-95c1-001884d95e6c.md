The real number that represents the scale of the conformal transformation.

**Namespace:**   [Autodesk.Revit.DB](87546ba7-461b-c646-cbb1-2cb8f5bff8b2.htm)    
  **Assembly:**   RevitAPI  (in RevitAPI.dll) Version: 21.0.0.0 (21.1.1.109)   
  **Since:**  2021

# Syntax

| C# |
| --- |
| ``` public double Scale { get; } ``` |

 

| Visual Basic |
| --- |
| ``` Public ReadOnly Property Scale As Double 	Get ``` |

 

| Visual C++ |
| --- |
| ``` public: property double Scale { 	double get (); } ``` |

# Remarks

When the transformation is conformal and can be decomposed as the product of a rigid-body motion, uniform scale and reflection, this property returns the scale value of the uniform scale transformation.

# Exceptions

| Exception | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| [Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions InvalidOperationException](9e715f03-3884-e539-4dd6-8d7545733adc.htm) | This transformation is not conformal and the scale is undefined. |
