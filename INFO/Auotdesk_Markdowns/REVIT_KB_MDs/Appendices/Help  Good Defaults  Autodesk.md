When a user needs to edit data or change a setting, the lack of any or obvious default can lead to errors and force users to re-edit and re-enter information. Remember to:

-   Set the control value with a reasonable default value for the current context by consulting usage data or using the previously entered values by the user. The appropriate default may be blank.
-   Where appropriate, remember the last used setting of the user instead of always presenting the same system default

A common example is pre-setting certain settings or options which would be the most often selected.
