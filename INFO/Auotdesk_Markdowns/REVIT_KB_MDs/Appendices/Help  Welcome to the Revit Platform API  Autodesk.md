# Help | Welcome to the Revit Platform API | Autodesk

> ## Excerpt
> All Autodesk Revit-based products are Parametric Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools. Such a tool can be looked at as a CAD program that is used to build a 3D model rather than a set of individual drawing files. Autodesk Revit modeling is accomplished with real-world elements like columns, walls, doors and windows. The user can create views of the model, including plans, sections and callouts. All these views are directly generated from the 3D physical model so changes made in one view will automatically propagate through all other views. This process virtually eliminates the need to update multiple drawings and details when a change is made in the model.

The Autodesk Revit API is designed to reflect the same user interaction paradigms as the program's Graphical User Interface. Therefore, the first step to understanding the API is to learn how to use the program. If you are an Autodesk Revit novice, we suggest you first start by going through the Tutorials which you can access through the program's Help menu. You may also find it helpful to take a Training class from your local Autodesk reseller. This will help you quickly get up to speed with the program
