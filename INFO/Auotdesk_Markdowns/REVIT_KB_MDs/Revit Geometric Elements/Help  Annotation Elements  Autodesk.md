This section covers Revit Annotation Elements, such as dimensions, text notes, keynotes, tags, and symbols.

Note that:

-   Dimensions are view-specific elements that display sizes and distances in a project.
-   Detail curves are created for detailed drawings. They are visible only in the view in which they are drawn. Often they are drawn over the model view.
-   Tags are an annotation used to identify elements in a drawing. Properties associated with a tag can appear in schedules.
-   AnnotationSymbol has multiple leader options when loaded into a project.
