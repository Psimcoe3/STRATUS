> ## Excerpt
> Classes in the Revit API in the Autodesk.Revit.DB.Architecture namespace allow access to stairs and related components such as landings and runs. Stairs can be created or modified using the Revit API. The Stairs class represents stairs created "by component". Stair elements that were created by sketch cannot be accessed as a Stair object in the API. The static method Stairs.IsByComponent() can be used to determine if an ElementId represents stairs that were created by component.
