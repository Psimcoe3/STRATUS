> ## Excerpt
> The Edge class represents the edge of a 3d solid. Edges are defined by intersections of surfaces that form faces of the solid. They have arbitrary parameterization that is normalized from 0 to 1. The EdgeEndPoint class represents the start or the end point of an Edge and SolidUtils.FindAllEdgeEndPointsAtVertex() finds all EdgeEndPoints at a vertex identified by the input EdgeEndPoint.

The `Edge` class represents the edge of a 3d solid. Edges are defined by intersections of surfaces that form faces of the solid. They have arbitrary parameterization that is normalized from 0 to 1. The `EdgeEndPoint` class represents the start or the end point of an Edge and `SolidUtils.FindAllEdgeEndPointsAtVertex()` finds all EdgeEndPoints at a vertex identified by the input EdgeEndPoint.
