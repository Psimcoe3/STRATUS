The Autodesk.Revit.DB namespace contains many classes related to geometry and graphic-related types used to describe the graphical representation in the API. The geometry-related classes include:

-   [GeometryObject class](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2023/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Revit_Geometric_Elements_Geometry_GeometryObject_Class_html) - Includes classes derived from the GeometryObject class.
-   [Geometry Helper Classes](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2023/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Revit_Geometric_Elements_Geometry_Geometry_Helper_Classes_html) - Includes classes derived from the APIObject class and value types
-   [Geometry Utility Classes](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2023/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Revit_Geometric_Elements_Geometry_Geometry_Utility_Classes_html) - Includes classes to create non-element geometry and to find intersections of solids
-   [Collection Classes](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2023/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Revit_Geometric_Elements_Geometry_Collection_Classes_html) - Includes classes derived from the IEnumerable or IEnumerator interface.

In this section, you learn how to use various graphic-related types, how to retrieve geometry data from an element, how to transform an element, and more.
