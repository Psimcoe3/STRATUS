> A working understanding of Autodesk Revit.

1.  A working understanding of Autodesk Revit.
    
2.  An installation of an Autodesk Revit-based product, including the Software Development Kit.
    
3.  MS Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (C# or VB.NET). Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Professional is recommended, though, as Community editions do not support DLL debugging. Alternatively, you can use the built-in SharpDevelop development environment in Revit.
    
4.  Some experience in a .NET based development language. (Autodesk Revit API examples are provided in C# and Visual Basic.NET.)
