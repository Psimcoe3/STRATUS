Understanding and communicating within the user's language is always critical, but particularly within a user interface. Users will need to provide as well as receive feedback from the application.

The tone used in user interface language should be informal, helpful, and consultative in tone. The user interface should politely provide information that is clear and informative to the user, and that can be acted upon accordingly with confidence.
