A well-balanced layout of information can be achieved by following Gestalt Principles:

-   Proximity: items placed close together are perceived as being closely associated
-   Similarity: items that share similar appearance are perceived as being closely associated
-   Continuity: humans tend to prefer simple, unbroken contours over more complex, yet similarly plausible forms
