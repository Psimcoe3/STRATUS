> ## Excerpt
> In object-oriented programming (OOP), classes are used to group related Properties (variables) and Methods (functions) together. A typical class describes how those methods operate upon and manipulate the properties. Classes can be standalone or inherited from other classes. In the latter, a class from which others are derived is usually referred to as a Base Class.
