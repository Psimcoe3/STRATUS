Every building has a unique place in the world because the Latitude and Longitude are unique. In addition, a building can have many locations in relation to other buildings. The Revit Platform API Site namespace uses certain classes to save the geographical location information for Revit projects.

Note: The Revit Platform API does not expose the Site menu functions. Only Site namespace provides functions corresponding to the Location options found on the Project Location panel on the Manage tab.
