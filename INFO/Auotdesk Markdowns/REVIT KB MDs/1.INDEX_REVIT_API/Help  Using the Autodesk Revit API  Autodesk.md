## Autodesk Revit SDK and Online Help

The Autodesk Revit API Software Development Kit (SDK) is installed from the Tools and Utilities section of the Autodesk Revit installation. In the SDK, there are example files that will help you get a better understanding of the API and its use. Each example file has a sample .addin manifest file with the information that you will need to edit and place into the appropriate folder, which Autodesk Revit will access on launch.

RevitAPI.chm is the Autodesk Revit API reference documentation help chm file, included with the SDK package in the \\Revit 2018 SDK\\ folder.
