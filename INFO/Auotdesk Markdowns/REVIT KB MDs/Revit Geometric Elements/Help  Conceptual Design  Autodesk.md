> ## Excerpt
> This chapter discusses the conceptual design functionality of the Revit API for the creation of complex geometry in a family document. Form-making is supported by the addition of new objects: points and spline curves that pass through these points. The resulting surfaces can be divided, patterned, and panelized to create buildable forms with persistent parametric relationships.
